0,t3_y144xh,How to do a Masters in a completely unrelated field?,"Hi guys,

I'm close to finishing my Bachelors in Entrepreneurship, in Germany.   
Here's the plan. I'm going to do a Masters in of the fields of the future (Neurosciences, Nanotech, Biotech, Genomics, AI). We could talk about Why, but the burning issue for me is How I would get accepted into one in the EU.

You see, universities in the EU want you to at least have 30-60 CPs in the fields of the Masters, if not having studied the entire Bachelor in the field of the Masters. And while this is very reasonable, I don't have the time for another 3-4 years of a Bachelor that can at most, teach me something general, while I need to focus down on something very specific. My current Bachelors is almost finished, so hacking some Maths, CS or Biology classes in those 180 CPs won't work.

Any ideas? 

I was thinking of doing an entire EdX programme and pay for the certification, to use that as a bridge. Heck, I would even do a suitable Microbachelor if that solves the issue. My Bachelor thesis, on which I'm currently working, is also about these futuristic technologies.",8,0.9,/r/edX/comments/y144xh/how_to_do_a_masters_in_a_completely_unrelated/,edX

3,t3_xtszjt,APA Format Citation Guide,"1. APA Referencing Basics: Reference List
A reference list is a complete list of references used in a piece of writing including the author name, date of publication, title and more. An APA reference list must:

Be on a new page at the end of the document

Be centred

Be alphabetically by name of first author (or title if the author isn’t known, in this case a, an and the should be ignored)

If there are multiple works by the same author these are ordered by date, if the works are in the same year they are ordered alphabetically by the title and are allocated a letter (a,b,c etc) after the date

Contain full references for all in-text references used


2. APA Referencing Basics: In-Text Citation
In-text references must be included following the use of a quote or paraphrase taken from another piece of work.

In-text citations are citations within the main body of the text and refer to a direct quote or paraphrase. They correspond to a reference in the main reference list. These citations include the surname of the author and date of publication only. Using an example author James Mitchell, this takes the form:

Mitchell (2017) states… Or …(Mitchell, 2017).

The structure of this changes depending on whether a direct quote or parenthetical used:

Direct Quote: The citation must follow the quote directly and contain a page number after the date, for example (Mitchell, 2017, p.104). This rule holds for all of the variations listed.

Parenthetical: The page number is not needed.

Two Authors:
The surname of both authors is stated with either ‘and’ or an ampersand between. For example:

Mitchell and Smith (2017) state… Or …(Mitchell &amp; Smith, 2017).

Three, Four or Five Authors:
For the first cite, all names should be listed:

Mitchell, Smith, and Thomson (2017) state… Or …(Mitchell, Smith, &amp; Thomson, 2017).

Further cites can be shorted to the first author’s name followed by et al:

Mitchell et al (2017) state… Or …(Mitchell et al, 2017).

Six or More Authors:
Only the first author’s surname should be stated followed by et al, see the above example.

No Authors:
If the author is unknown, the first few words of the reference should be used. This is usually the title of the source.

If this is the title of a book, periodical, brochure or report, is should be italicised. For example:

(A guide to citation, 2017).

If this is the title of an article, chapter or web page, it should be in quotation marks. For example:

(“APA Citation”, 2017).

Citing Authors With Multiple Works From One Year:

Works should be cited with a, b, c etc following the date. These letters are assigned within the reference list, which is sorted alphabetically by the surname of the first author. For example:

(Mitchell, 2017a) Or (Mitchell, 2017b).

Citing Multiple Works in One Parentheses:

If these works are by the same author, the surname is stated once followed by the dates in order chronologically. For instance:

Mitchell (2007, 2013, 2017) Or (Mitchell, 2007, 2013, 2017)

If these works are by multiple authors then the references are ordered alphabetically by the first author separated by a semicolon as follows:

(Mitchell &amp; Smith 2017; Thomson, Coyne, &amp; Davis, 2015).

Citing a Group or Organisation:

For the first cite, the full name of the group must be used. Subsequently this can be shortened. For example:

First cite: (International Citation Association, 2015)

Further Cites: (Citation Association, 2015)

Citing a Secondary Source:

In this situation the original author and date should be stated first followed by ‘as cited in’ followed by the author and date of the secondary source. For example:

Lorde (1980) as cited in Mitchell (2017) Or (Lorde, 1980, as cited in Mitchell, 2017)

41,t3_wh18dn,NYUx Programming &amp; Data Structures Microbachelors Review,"**TL;DR - This is a low quality, low effort course, do not waste your money** I think MOOCs generally get an unfair negative reputation from employers and academics, but it's deserved in this case.

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT:** Adding more details I thought of while studying for final. I'm not sure if you can change any lab grades after you take the final so I'm stuck waiting for the grade book to update.

&amp;#x200B;

Hello, I couldn't find a lot of information on this course before I signed up, so I thought I'd leave a detailed review here now that I've nearly completed it. Course info here: [https://www.edx.org/microbachelors/nyux-programming-data-structures](https://www.edx.org/microbachelors/nyux-programming-data-structures)

&amp;#x200B;

**My background:** I earned a STEM degree from a research university over 10 years ago. I have been employed in a STEM field ever since then and have earned multiple engineering certifications. I would describe myself as technologically literate, but had no coding experience prior to this course.

**Overall Impressions:** The first two classes in this course are OK as an overall intro to programming in C++. There are many YouTube channels that are higher quality and free. If you're not looking for cheap academic credits, there's no reason to pick this over a YouTube video or book. The next two courses teach you about data structures and OOP. They are vague and high level. The general theory of how different features of C++ work is explained, but not when or how to use them, and there's precious few code examples. To me it was sort of like... *""ok now I know all these things exist and the very basics of how they will work. Cool. Now I know what to google later.""* **Although you get a ""microbachelors"" degree from this course, you will absolutely not be equipped for changing careers.**  It's really more of an introduction to concepts you need to learn. You get six college credits (not sure if they're semester or quarter credits) from Thomas Edison State University, not NYU. I can't say if these will transfer into a CS program at other schools. Even if they do, **I don't plan to transfer these credits as I don't feel I've learned a fraction of what I should from a college class**, I fully plan on retaking a data structures class  from a ""real"" college.

&amp;#x200B;

**What I didn't like about the course:**

* It's pretty clear these videos were recycled content from other courses. The readings were from W3 School or Wikipedia. If a student is paying for a class I think it's disrespectful and lazy that they're just linked to a Wikipedia article. The videos and homework often reference things you have not learned in either the readings or previous videos.
* The code snippets in the example problems are often written in C or Python and not C++
* I feel like an a--hole for saying it, but the professor that teaches most of the courses has an irritating verbal tick. He's not hard to understand, just annoying. He says ""uh uh uh uhhhhh"" mid sentence quite often and it's distracting. If you play the videos on 2x speed or mute and just read the captions it's not as bad
* There is a professor or TA that responds to questions, but they're not that helpful or quick. I've waited as long as two weeks on occasion for my grades to update. I get that people go on vacation or have midterms to grade, but send out a course announcement EDIT: they say they update the grade book every day at 5pm eastern. This is definitely not the case. 
* I will update to confirm after I get my certificate, but I believe this shows up as a Pass/Fail on a transcript so you can't use it to pad your GPA
* There are precious few code examples in general and they are gone through quite quickly, or sometimes have things on screen blocking parts of the code. Lecture transcripts do not include the example code and are not formatted at all.
* Introduction to functions was unnecessarily complicated.
* There is almost no information about debugging
* You likely won't be ready to write your own programs (beyond very simple ones) or read other people's code after just this class

**What I did like:**

* A little cheaper than ""regular"" college
* Self paced
* Gives college credit
* You get really good at googling, problem solving, and troubleshooting because the lectures don't always provide the information you need
* EDIT: This is a very low pressure course (see additional info below)
* EDIT: Although I was disappointed by the depth and quality of the content overall, with this course I feel I got enough of an overview of C++ to more effectively self learn, still probably not worth the $1200 USD price tag

&amp;#x200B;

**Niche situations where I would actually recommend the course:**

* You are not paying for it with your own money (IE employer education stipend)
* You already know some C++/Data structures and you want cheaper college credit to give yourself some academic credibility
* You plan to use this certificate/credit to augment your application to a CS program at your college/university

&amp;#x200B;

**Tips for success if you do take this course:**

* If you didn't understand the lecture, watch the video again. If it's still not making sense, find a youtube video, book, or stack exchange post. Murach's C++ Programming book explains everything way better and has much better code examples and explanations. I haven't used [learncpp.com](https://learncpp.com) very much, but it has a good reputation, and from what little I have browsed on it, way more practical code examples.
* To really get the most out of this course you need to find practice problems from other sources. Unless you have a photographic memory, writing a few if statements and while loops probably won't be enough for most people to engrain the syntax

&amp;#x200B;

**Addition Information (Added in first post edit):** 

* Grading is weighted as 40% labs/homework, 30% quizzes, 30% final exam 
* The quizzes allow unlimited attempts. Each question is graded as you do it. So you can literally click every answer until you pick the right one. 
* The final exam of each class reuses the exact questions from the quiz. It's graded similarly to the quizzes, you get multiple tries, but I'm not sure if they're unlimited. You will need your own computer with a webcam to take the exam. A school or work computer may not allow you to download the proctoring software. They record you taking the exam and then review it to make sure you did not cheat. So you can take it any time you want.
* I don't know if all edX classes grade their exams and quizzes like this, or if the microbachelors will continue to be graded like this going forward. So please do your best to actually understand the material and get the questions correct the first time. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Additional Resources (Added in first edit, since a few of you have asked):**

* [https://exercism.org/](https://exercism.org/) (free) and [https://edabit.com/](https://edabit.com/) (paid but very good) for practice problems
* [https://www.learncpp.com/](https://www.learncpp.com/) free online resource with examples
* [https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming](https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming) for help with the first two classes and [https://www.programiz.com/dsa](https://www.programiz.com/dsa) for help with the second two classes. It's less in depth but more digestible than learncpp
* [https://www.murach.com/shop/murach-s-c-programming-2nd-edition-detail](https://www.murach.com/shop/murach-s-c-programming-2nd-edition-detail) Murach's C++ guide if you want a paper book 
* YouTube - try a few channels and see what clicks with you. This is down to personal preference but I really liked Coding Beauty's simple and short explanations [https://www.youtube.com/c/CodeBeauty](https://www.youtube.com/c/CodeBeauty)

\-I work 10 hours per day. 

\-Time for study: the nights (two hours and half) and sundays.

In the past year, I finished one Professional Certificate in Edx.

I know that a MicroMasters is more difficult and challenge, but I need this to advance in my career.

The UC San Diego MicroMasters Program in Data Science it's very attractive to me, but, if you see the page of this program, says 10 months, but if you see the four courses separately, they say ""self-paced"".

I don't understand if I can buy the entired program an do it self-paced or if once I buy it, I need to do the entired program in 10 months or less (the four courses have assignments that must be completed every week?)

This is extremly important to me, for the hours I work per day.

In other hand, other Micromaster like Big Data (University of Adelaide) or Big Data Technology (HKUST) in the main page of the entired programm, says ""self-paced"".

Especially when comparing it to CS50, which I did earlier (for free on their own website, instead of the paid CS50x version).

I'm doing the whole professional certificate (already paid) and I hope the depth will increase, but given the content and comparing the scope to other courses, this whole program should cost a maximum of  those $150 they charge for the first of nine courses.

So I decided to apply for fee waivers, however, it was saying I must write at least 1250 words for each question(there are three questions) and it wasn't saying in which language should I write my essays(the fee waiver page was in Turkish but all edX pages are in English).

I am just about to finish my master's in mathematics with specialization in numerical maths and algorithms in Germany. I have some theoretical knowledge as I've worked myself through parts of the book ""understanding machine learning: from theory to algorithms'"", especially in the neural network chapter I've gone into detail. Furthermore I have taken a computer science deep learning course that, however, was not too practical. In my master's thesis I have trained a yolov3 network, but that was more of a tool than my actual focus.

Now I will have about 1.5 to 2 free months before I'll start working at my university again (the focus will lie on the connection of classical numerical methods and deep learning). In that free time and potentially parallel to my job I would like to gain some further knowledge and maybe even gain some further qualification in the machine learning field. One goal might be to get some practical experience with constructing and training networks for different purposes. Another might be to get more into the stochastical part where I may be lacking expertise. I wouldn't mind getting another mini bachelor or master degree in that field either. But as I'm new to edx, I am a little lost about where to start informing myself and what fitting options are.

301,t3_ktdvdx,Refunds for a course you purchased in a bundle?,"Hey team, I wanted to inquire here because I'm in a bit of a strange position.

I read some of the online FAQs, and it's still not clear what would happen in my situation. On 07-21-2020, I purchased a 3-pack micromasters bundle from EdX in order to better prepare myself for the online Masters of Analytics at Georgia Tech. These 3 courses are foundational courses for the MSA at GTech and are officially a part of the program.

So, I finished 2 of the 3 courses, both A's in both, and was accepted to the program. Now I am about to start my first semester. However, completing the courses via EdX doesn't count towards your GPA, only for credit, and the cutoff is higher as an EdX student than as a GTech student.

So I've decided to take the course as a GTech student - even though it's more expensive... - because I would like to get a bit of a GPA buffer. After all, I've 'squandered' 2 of the easier courses. Those two A's I've gotten will not count towards my GPA, though they will count as credits towards graduation.

My question then is can I still get a refund for this final course in the bundle? I never selected a start/term date for the third course and it has not yet been 6 months since I paid (I still have a few weeks it seems.)

According to the FAQs, I currently cannot ""unenroll"" in the course without selecting a start date/term. I am hesitant to do so without knowing if that will break something. Should I select a term then use the little gear to unenroll? Will that give me an automatic refund? (The FAQ says within the first 14 days within joining the course or up to 6 months after your payment, and since I haven't joined the 3rd course yet then both shouldn't have happened yet right?)  


Part of why I care here is that I would ideally like to do all of the courses together on one EdX account, especially because the EdX honor code says I should only have 1 account.

I would love to hear if someone else had a similar experience and how they resolved, it thanks so much!",5,0.86,/r/edX/comments/ktdvdx/refunds_for_a_course_you_purchased_in_a_bundle/,edX

I have the opportunity to pick up one of the above courses and I am struggling to decide which one.

The Harvard course is just 2-3 hours a week for 17 months. It is taught in R. It covers: R, visualisation, probability, inference &amp; modelling, linear regression, machine learning. I would learn R which is great, because I currently only know Python.

The MIT course is 10-14 hours a week for 14 months.  It is taught in Python and covers: Uncertainty, statistics, ML (linear to deep learning) .

The MIT course is a much bigger commitment, but it seems like the learning outcomes are very similar on paper. 

I'd be very keen to hear about fundamental differences in the courses, why the MIT course is SO much more work and whether it will be seen as more valuable by employers.

I have a few questions that I thought you might be able to help with.

2. As a follow up to that, how fresh in mind will that info need to be? It's been a long time since I took calculus and I don't remember much. Maybe it will come back when I start using it, but it's not fresh.  
3. Can I start one class in the program and then decide later if I want to do the full program, or do I have to register for the full program before starting? 
4. Same question for the certificate for each class - can I start the first class and decide along the way if I want to obtain the certificate/credit or do I have to register for credit before I start? 
5. Do other schools accept the MIT Mircomasters program as credit towards their full MS finance/MBAs? Meaning, if I do the Micromasters and apply to a school other than MIT, are they likely to accept the courses/credits or am I likely to need to start fresh?

Or is it like Coursera, where it’s (terrible) peer graded work and forums where thousands ask questions that never get answered?

I’ve found overall that for technical skills courses like this, the ability to ask questions and interact helps quite a lot with learning. I may go another route that’s more expensive if there isn’t much to the certificate besides watching videos and typing along.

I am a freshman and starting out on data science, which is something I'm really interested in exploring. I checked the coupon out on a certain course, which was worth $149 with the verified track. However, I realised it was a hasty decision and reading the refund policy, which extended up to 14 days, I unenrolled from the course within the next 5 minutes. I found one I actually wanted to do but the coupon didn't apply. A dialog window said it was already used and couldn't be used again. Since I didn't read anywhere an iota of the fact that an access coupon couldn't be used again if unenrolled from the same account within the refund period I thought it safe to to ahead with. It wasn't mentioned in the email from edX I received that gave me the access code, and neither did I see it while checking out on the course payment window itself. 
I mailed the customer care department about it and they reached out to me in a few minutes saying a code could only be checked out once.
THIS IS NOT A RANT. I'd just prefer it if edX gave some sort of disclaimer or included this in the FAQs or at least on their refund policy page. And even if I'm in the wrong and this actually does exist somewhere on their website, it should be more prominent is all I'm saying.
But with all due sincerity, edX is genuinely an excellent platform and kudos to such a site which has taken such a significant step in universalising education and skill development.

This seems like an amazing value proposition compared to the traditional full MBA route. I understand the benefits of networking during a traditional MBA abut that’s not a large desire of mine because I work in a niche industry.

I have just started a new course at edx but I still haven't decided if I'm going to go for the certificate or not.

I've been watching/assisting videos and trying to solve all problems.

I'm new to these online courses and it's details.

So, I have a few questions.

When I started the course, I was asked to chose one of 3 options.

Explore the Course

Earn a Certificate

Complete the Course

I still haven't made up my mind and in my dashboard, it says I'll lose the access to the course by January 15th.

So, if I choose Explore or Complete the Course options, will I still lose the access to the contents of the course?

If I pay for the certificate, will I have access to any extra resources? What about the textbook? Do I need to pay to have access to the textbook?

If I chose to Exlpore or Complete the couse, will I have access to the homeworks, labs an final exam (only not the certificate)?

If I keep going with the course withing deciding if I'm going for the certificate, can I decide it right before finishing the course? Or I have to decide before January the 15th?

Will I lose all my progress after January the 15th if I don't pay for the cretificate?

As up to now, when I check my progress, all items are zeroed. Points, percentages, everything is zeroed. Is this because I still haven't paid? I mean, do I only have those progress available if I go for the certificate?

There are points we earn for answering questions. Are this points active if we don't pay for the certificate? What if I only decide in the middle of the course? Will all points since the beginning will be activated? How that works?

Sorry for so many questions

I figured i have to start fresh and enroll in: Professional Certificate in Introduction to Computer Science

* Fundamentals of analytic logic
* How logic relates to computer science
* How to write basic programs in Python
* Functions, loops, and conditionals in Python
* How to process files

Will that be the total cost of all 4 program courses that come with this program?

When i clink the link on the program courses i see ""Add a Verified Certificate for $99 USD"" 

Does this mean i pay $267.30 to take the course and if i want the Certificate for each program i would need to pay an extra $99 right?

and for the ones that are willing to pay for a verified certificate or succeeded in the financial aid if they also can provide us with the graded assignments that will really help a lot and I believe that is something we can all do that will help us to get all the free knowledge that we can get without paying a lot of money.  


I hope that a lot of you will help me doing something like this it may take some efforts but we all gonna be happy at the end.

As far as I know, there is no recapcha in the login process, a hacker can theoretically get infinite times of login attempts, and there is no two step verification, either. 

And a downloaded certificate really doesn't say much since it's just a pdf file that can be easily faked.

It seems coursera does nothing better than edx. Before this issue is resolved, I won't consider paying for any certificate again on any online course platform.

757,t3_9cw6fb,Basic statistics + programing,"Hello people, 

&amp;#x200B;

I am a medical student and I would like to learn some statistics and how to implement it in some programing language. I have some basic knowledge of statistics (mean, variance, standard deviation, power analysis, t-tests, ANOVA) but I would like to learn more. 

&amp;#x200B;

For the last couple of weeks I have been doing the ""Statistics and R"" course on [edx.com](https://edx.com). The first quarter of the course was pretty easy and basic stuff so I had no problem. Then they start talking about t-distributions and central limit theorem and confidence intervals and I got lost. The course has a textbook and some videos, I went through the textbook twice and still couldnt understand what they were talking about or how to solve most of the exercises. After some googling many I realized that many people have the same problem, complaining that the course is not structured well enough. So I decided to search for something else. 

&amp;#x200B;

So as I said I am searching something about the basics of statistics, it would be nice if it was a program so I can take more advanced courses later on. About the programing languages I know a bit of matlab and R but I am willing to start something new if the course is worth it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any ideas?

1) Does a certificate really makes a difference? I mean do people actually care if you have an online course certificate? I don't  know any people that have ever done online classes with certificate so I have no experience. 

2) . So the course I am doing right now is self-paced and it is supposed to be 4 weeks. It expires in 6 months. Does that mean that I should do all the program courses in 6 months, is it something like a semester in which I gotta complete it all?

773,t3_8zlup9,What does a computer science degree look like?,"I have a background in engineering and I have decided to embark on a journey to become a computer scientist and work in the field.

At this point of my life I do not have the time nor money to start a full university degree and I also think that in some ways it's not really worth it as I already did engineering degrees and have a deep understanding of advanced mathematics, engineering and several other fields.

Now what I try to do is set up a personal study program that would lead me to having a undergrad equivalent knowledge of computer science and I believe that would be immensely helpful to my career.

A typical degree at my own university (where I studied several years ago) would look like this:

- Year 1: 4 quarters classes and projects
- Year 2: 4 quarters classes and projects
- Year 3: 1 quarter bachelor assignment, 1 quarter minor (not related to the field you study), 2 quarters classes and projects

After following such a program for 3 years you would be rewarded with a BSc degree and you can enter a relevant Master degree program.

Now considering I already did a minor, that there should be some overlap between computer science and what I studied and I intend to gain experience in the workplace similar to projects in a computer science program, I'm looking up to about 1,5 to 2 years of a full time program to reach undergrad equivalent knowledge of computer science. If I spend 20 hours a week, that means that in about 3 to 4 years (maybe even less considering long university holiday breaks) I could achieve my goals.

On top of that, I've studied C++ over the past couple of months. That should also cut down my deficit with a few weeks.

It also means that I need to focus my attention to the more theoretic (but not skip practice), less project, less extracurricular, less final assignment part of such a degree.

I've found some Youtube as well as edX lectures on Harvard's CS50 course (which I guess is the first course they start with when they arrive at Harvard). I understand that the course is supposed to take 12 weeks for Harvard students and that they get about 2-3 hours of lectures per week. What else is going on in their program? How much other work does the course require? How many other courses do Harvard students take simultaneously during this period? Can I find these (or similar courses) online, either on edX or somewhere else?

I've also found some material on Khan Academy and while very helpful, it's also quite basic and I expect to be done within 2 weeks with everything Khan Academy offers on computer science.

I also found [this Harvard brochure on computer science](http://cdn.cs50.net/guide/guide-21.pdf) and I guess my focus should be on the Concentrators part. I see a lot of things I already know, so that's good, but I don't really know how higher education works in the US, so I'm not sure what to think of it. I will search online whether Harvard also offers these other courses online.

I just watched a 1 hour Harvard CS50 lecture on Youtube and I'd like to think I got 1 hour closer to a computer science degree equivalent level of knowledge.",5,1.0,/r/edX/comments/8zlup9/what_does_a_computer_science_degree_look_like/,edX

793,t3_82ldwu,edX Certificate removed because of deleted grades,"[UPDATE: I followed @RebelUpwards advice and sent a new request for student support. Got the certificate back this morning.] 

I just want to share an issue I had with the edX platform in the last month or so. Hopefully individuals with a similar or different experience can contribute so prospective students are better informed before paying for a certificate. 

In the beginning of this school year, I subscribed to the Introduction to Probability Part 1 (6.041.1x) course by MITx. After a while, I figured I was probably going to finish it so I purchased the certificate and went on to pass the class around December. By then, I had my hard-earned certificate. 

A couple weeks passed and I found out that all my grades from the exercises in the course had been removed (not those of the problem sets or the exams). I brought the problem to the attention of a customer agent who confirmed that the grades had been mistakenly removed giving me a failing grade. He seemed to acknowledge that all the grades for the exercises were removed, in which case I would not be the only oneafflicted. Anyway, after contacting the agent, my certificate was also removed. 

This was a month or so ago. Now, I've been on and off discussing with the customer agent, with him letting me know that the issue was worked on... Since this is a seemingly simple problem, I grew tired after 3 weeks or so of discussing and politely asked for my money back. Since then, I've heard nothing back and don't expect hearing anything back. 

I will try to avoid edX services in the future, although I have enjoyed the three classes I've taken with them. I value the certificates and monetary investments as elements of motivation and I feel like security of expectations is really mandatory to a learning experience. 

By the way, I do have a link saved of the certificate but it is not valid since it has been removed from my account. Next time, I will save a picture.

907,t3_593pbs,MITx Supply Chain MicroMasters,"I just completed the 3rd course in this series.

**I'm beginning to think that the people actually running these courses are actively trying to prevent the program from working.**

The staff does not provide any feedback or help. They don't answer any questions except to vaguely accuse the student of cheating. Almost ALL useful answers in all three courses so far come from a single student who is active in the message boards (username iv).

I just completed a final that depended heavily on a simple calculation that was never given or defined in the course. It came up on a previous graded homework, many questions were asked about how this should be calculated, and it was never answered. It is not a concept that was answered in any of the supplemental readings or can easily be defined, because it varies by industry and country - and even by company.

What I have seen online is a great deal of resentment among students &amp; professors about the MITx program, and that no one should benefit from MIT learning unless they are accepted to the campus and pay the enormous tuition. **What I see happening in MITx is blatant protectionism by these groups by refusing to support the MITx program, and trying to make it as difficult as possible for the students.**

A week ago I met an MIT professor who is currently on sabbatical, and got the same impression from him: the staff resent the MITx program and are forced to participate against their will. How can this possibly be successful?

It is a badly designed exam when I can pass the concept questions with 95% accuracy, and then fail the overall exam because so many points depend on a simple calculation that was never given, and cannot be extrapolated from the information in the course (it is never addressed!).

I feel I have wasted a great deal of time &amp; effort on a program that is becoming more impossible to complete with every course. Not to mention has NO real-world value:

926,t3_4t14wk,Unusual question,"Out of necessity, I have to ask a serious but unusual question here. I'm sorry if it's inappropriate  somehow. No one owe me anything or has an obligation to try to answer me, but to those who reply, out of compassion and a sense of  humanitarianism, my sincere thanks.

A short background: 

I was raised to be part of the intellectual elite that is the support of the political group in power in my country. That means I have been given a decent erudition in a large variety of cultural matters, a good knowledge of the so called Human ""Sciences"" but, in fact, have never learned anything vaguely useful for society. Not a single skill that could make me desirable for hiring, I believe.

Having finally discovered that the ideologies I had always subscribed to where in fact nothing but evil tyranny disguised as democracy, and the politicians I have helped to stay in power where nothing other than cruel psychopaths whose only desire is for personal power and to cause people's suffering, I have renounced both and denounced them publicly. 

That, of course, has put me in their blacklist: I have lost my recently acquired position as a teacher at a university, lost my graduation and PhD diplomas and the governmental authorization to ever teach Philosophy again. Any governmental job is out of question for me. All of this illegally, but around here ""law"" is the will of those in power.

In my country there is no such a thing even remotely resembling a free-market, and every private business depends on the government. Thus no business owner will ever hire me to any job, not even to scrub floors or to deliver pizzas, as that would mean their business' fall into disgrace and soon, their end. 

My former colleagues, most of my relatives, old friends and acquaintances just look at the ground whenever near me, and pretend they don't know me, as they fear for their jobs and their lives. Talking to a pariah is too dangerous around here, as no one knows who is looking or hearing...

So here I stand, with my kids on the verge of starvation, and with all conventional paths blocked to me.

Finally, my question:

Is there, on EDX or any other online sites, any course or group of courses which could make me desirable for a private business to hire? It would have to be a business in another country, and it could be either to work while physically in my country, via Internet... Or even better, it could be a job in which I had to move to another country. Or both, within due time.

Moving would be great, because while I don't fear for my life properly, I fear for that of my wife and kids.

Some  pros I have is that experience shows I can learn mostly anything with easy. Also I have read thousands of books, including all the great classics.

A con is that I'm relatively older (40+)

To those who answer, once again my sincere thanks, and to those who have come this far my deep apologies for my lack of proficiency in English.

I logged in to submit my work on the due date at 9pm where I live and where the school is located (EST) and it would not allow me to upload anything. As a result I did not pay the $50 as I assumed this would mean I could not complete the course. Since then I have been acing everything and am surely going to complete the course. It no longer will allow me to pay for verified now anyway but I was curious what would have happened if I paid and had an incomplete. Would the verified document state this or would I not even get a verified document and just be out $50? My plan now is to retake the course once I am done as it will be cake and a second run through it would probably be helpful anyway as reinforcement however this will cause me to delay taking other verified courses as I have to run through one twice. I tried e-mailing edX as soon as I got the incomplete to see if I could somehow resolve it and pay for verified but got no response from them.

I'm not sure I'm so fond of that approach (though I am familiar with the content).  I understand why he's doing it.  There's been a trend in teaching programming the last ten years or so where the intro courses shouldn't merely focus on programming, but should cover other CS topics early on.

That's great, but the drawback is that these topics have to be glossed over quickly because there's not time to explore it in depth.

Also, there's not much in the way of practice during the lectures (not that I expect that), but it means the quizzes are sometimes testing things that are covered rather lightly.

I've also (being a sloppy reader) misread some of the quizzes and gotten them incorrect due to that.  Oh well.

[https://www.coursera.org/specializations/c-programming](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/c-programming)

Technical background before the course:

* Audio Engineering degree, some experience with DSP.
* 2 years of Python scripting.
* 1 year working in game dev, pseudo-technical topics (failure).

Motivation:

* Switch careers. Improve in technical interviews. Learn computer science topics fundamentals.

Outcome:

* Just finished it. Took me 17 weeks. I'll update this post with job news. I'm also currently in a Data Analytics Bootcamp.

**Review:**

Material: 5/5

Lessons: 4/5

Assignments: 3/5

  
The verdict is that they did a good job teaching the ""programmer mindset"" combined with computer science topics and gluing it all together with practical C problems. If you have no computer science background it will be frustrating and painful, you just have to keep going. I knew Python before starting with the course but I was an idiot. This course made me a way better programmer overall because it was successful in shaping my brain in the right way to understand computation and problem solving in general.

The bad stuff is the environment for the assignments. The first course requires peer review which is always a terrible idea for the first course because the majority of participants don't care about the topics as they just want to pass for whatever rightful reason they have. Also getting a response in the forums from the TA may take a week or two.

For the following courses, you have to deal with Emacs, which you can avoid by downloading the material and work on your local machine. However, I went with it and learned it, I'm not sure if it was for the best, as now I use Emacs on my local machine, checkmate Andrew. I mostly use it for taking notes with org-mode as I still use VSCode for other work.

This brings me to git, Linux, GNU, and other nerd things. I think the course is pretty good at opening the right doors to learning more about these topics but it won't go too deep into them, it's on you to learn details about all that if you like it or find it useful.

About the assignments themselves, they are mostly good as they manage to land a few topics from the lessons gracefully but some others become small gotcha games of ""how many times did you read the 400 lines README?"" or ""you didn't know about hex-mode for editing binary files?"" so reading the forums becomes a MUST before starting any assignments as you never know which one is gonna get you because you are human.

The final project was a bit uninteresting for me as you have to build a poker Monte Carlo simulation and I don't care about poker, so going over the domain part of the problem was a chore. Then there is the C problem part of the project which really requires a lot of attention to detail because you just learned about structs with pointers to arrays of pointers and you must make sure to free the memory of other structs pointing to the pointers in your first struct before freeing the memory of your first struct, which is only easy in retrospective. Then in between, you are bothered by parsing string characters and handling any possible mistakes in the input without stopping the program, as only certain breaking bugs need to stop the program. So you need to sit for a day trying to break your own code with test cases that you are sure the 1000 lines README is hinting at but can't make sense of, or maybe you don't really understand what a straight flush in poker is because you've only played it in your mother language and are confusing the English terms.

**Tips**

1. Take as much time to understand stuff like Makefiles, git, Linux commands before you move in too deep with the C stuff as the organization of your work is very important to keep the learning process smooth and finish high-complexity tasks soon.
2. Either take your time to learn Emacs or just forget about it and download all the content to your computer. Just make sure you are compiling and testing the code. Make sure you do research on tools for your OS for compiling C code, etc. I was able to compile and run everything on macOS Catalina except for Valgrind.  Memory was not an issue at the very end of the course but I used the Coursera environment for Valgrind almost exclusively for two whole weeks, so take note of all the Valgrind flags.
3. Use the debugger (gdb) as soon as you can. What I mean is that if you read the README for the third time, added an assertion, a printf, and changed the test case and it doesn't work, stop everything and use the debugger. Half of the time I could've saved an hour or two by using gdb sooner.
4. Take as many notes as you can, especially in the first couple of courses, as there are a lot of diagrams and concepts to learn. The key to internalizing the lessons from the first course for me was to grab a notebook and fill it with notes of the steps for the algorithms even if they are repetitive. I moved into digital notes in Emacs for the last two courses, and it works the same.
5. Write tests often, even if they are not in C (if you are working locally you can use Python, etc). The final project is a lot of individual pieces put together, make sure to test the individual pieces right after you write them before moving on, they mention this and it is obvious if you read every paragraph, I'm just repeating it for emphasis.
6. If you had the time to learn Emacs, learn org-mode, it really helped me deal with the complexity of the last few Final Project assignments. The key is to use noweb and separate source blocks under their respective headers with notes on what they do as well as paragraphs from the README so you really get to work on one thing at a time and write tests for it. Then reference them all in a single source block that tangles them into the ""input.c"" or ""main.c"" file. It helps me with organizing stuff that doesn't fit in my head if I look at it all at once (also known as chunking). This adds more nerd and technical overhead to your life but I think it is worth it if you want to learn more complex things in the future.

I think that's it for now, I wrote a lot already and I'm off to start another specialization. Hope this helps.",13,0.94,/r/coursera/comments/xmzerg/review_for_introductory_c_programming/,coursera

1319,t3_x2v6gy,Been away a while... it's all changed!,"Hi all,  
I did some Coursera courses a few years ago (about 7 years or so). On one of those, I paid extra to have a verified certificate (Into to Operations Management). I can't seem to find the same thing now that I'm completing Advanced Competitive Strategy.  
It looks like it's a monthly subscription thing now, rather than a fee-per-course.  
I have a couple of questions about how this works...  
Firstly... If I start paying the monthly sub now, do I get to generate certificates for courses which I've previoulsy completed (before the subscription started)?  
Secondly... If I pay the sub for, say, 6 months, and then stop... what happens to the certificates I've already achieved? Do they get scrubbed? Will my LinkedIn look like an embarrasment?  
  
Bonus question: My 'Completed Courses' bit doesn't show the 'Introduction to Operations Management' course I did years ago, and the payment for the certificate doesn't show in the 'My Purchases' section, either. I can see the course/certificate in the 'Accomplishments' section. Do these things get scrubbed after x amount of years? (I can still see 'Competitive Strategy' as a completed course, which was taken maybe a year or so after Operations Management).  
  
Thanks, this is going to take a bit of getting used to. I've flaired it as 'platform issue', because it's not a question about a specific course, and there's no 'platform question' flair. It's really more 'rusty end user issue' than anything else.",8,1.0,/r/coursera/comments/x2v6gy/been_away_a_while_its_all_changed/,coursera

""This three-week course follows Data Visualization in R with ggplot2 (I previously [shared my final submission](https://dh-data.org/posts/2022-06-06-my-jh-dataviz-submission/) to that prerequisite) and is also taught by the talented Collin Paschall. Despite being dubbed advanced, I perceived the difficulty to be low to moderate, if you are proficient with R; e.g., the peer-reviewed assignments are *easier* than those in the prerequisite course. The **strength** of the course is that it gave me practice in plots that otherwise I’d never make. The **weakness** is a relative lack of theory. I actually expected this course to go deeper into the grammatical theory, but you won’t find grammatical depth here. For theory, I tend to rely on [ggplot2: elegant graphics for data analysis](https://ggplot2-book.org/), and obviously the indispensibele [reference](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/index.html).

HOwever if I run the final part where I import this [networks.py](https://networks.py/) into the health\_checks.py, it says that I'm successful.

course link : [https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-it-automation](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-it-automation)

this is what i wrote in network .py :

\#!/usr/bin/env python3

import requests

import socket

def check\_localhost():

localhost = socket.gethostbyname('localhost')

return localhost == '127.0.0.1'

def check\_connectivity():

request = requests.get(""[http://www.google.com](http://www.google.com/)"")

return request.status\_code == 200

ignore the wrong indentaions here, I have used proper indentations there

I've also tried

if localhost == ""[127.0.0.1](https://127.0.0.1/)"":

return True

else:

return False (instead of return localhost == '127.0.0.1' )

AND

response = request.status\_code

if response ==200:

return True

return False (instead of return request.status\_code == 200)

* Following the instructions, the git clone shows an error message. Not a great sign...
* there's a file browser and you can see the clone operation slooooooooowly proceeding...
* in Step 2 of the lab they say to run one of their example workbooks. So I did... but the python in the widget always shows the same error (""restart the kernel"") , and when I do restart the kernel, the same error remains
* there's no way to delete the cloned workspace and try again. I renamed it and tried again, but the same thing happens.
* there's no way (I think??) to reset the lab environment

There's a Forums section for the class, but there's no help there. Maybe the problem is with the class? The Staff responding don't seem to understand the issue and literally just say to ""restart the kernel"" when I told them I did do that in the mail. They don't know the content of the class.

I don't think there is anyone who wrote the lab available on the Forums. There is no way to escalate, and no way to contact the instructors, Karthik Muthuraman and Romeo Kienzler. Do they know their names are on a class that doesn’t work?

So the larger issue is: there is basically no support for the broken tools. I'm not asking for help on the content of the class, but the tools literally will not start. Not surprisingly, the Support people cannot help, since they are only there to solve issues like payments.

And obviously, that means there's no recourse. I literally have to walk away from the entire class, and therefore the certificate for the 3 class cycle - that's I think 12 weeks of class that I took. Not to mention the 2 months of subscription fees I paid ($80).

It's upsetting, but I have to move on. Obviously I won't be taking more classes.

* Anybody else seen this issue where the Coursera app on android isn't loading practice quizzes?
* Anybody else observed Coursera support not letting you log in as your coursera account, instead using some random session account name?

Ideas?

the longer version:

I'm currently taking the Google Data Analytics class. I've decided I get things done well if I use my Android tablet while working on some mindless task (folding laundry etc.), so much so I got a bluetooth keyboard for it so I can type assignments etc. Videos and reading work fine. There's one hitch - practice quizzes (I haven't tried timed tests yet) don't load. I just get a blank grey box at the bottom with an X to close it.

I'm running the latest version of Android my tablet supports (which is up to date), I've tried disabling VPN, I've tried loading the offline version of the class ... nothing works. It's a UI issue/bug.

So, I tried to go to support - [coursera.support](https://coursera.support) to be precise. I try to log in (this is on Chrome on PC), but instead of logging in my account, like I have in [coursera.org](https://coursera.org), I'm automagically logged in as ""user1235423(really big number, I assume a GUID). Logging out and logging back in doesn't help. Next tab over in [coursera.org](https://coursera.org) I'm still logged in with my account - so it looks like they're not sharing cookies between the sessions/tabs ... ya know, what cookies are for.

Fine. Start a chat session (on the user123242etc account). It's been about twenty minutes now, and I'm still getting ""Waiting to Chat"" in the window.

I am trying to learn UX/UI and I stumbled upon Google UX Design course with certificate and although I'm absolutely broke, I am interested. Here are my (hopefully not stupid and convoluted) questions:

1. I tried applying for financial aid but I am confused. It made me choose a chapter and says original price is 49usd. As a first time user I thought this financial aid option applied to the whole course, not by chapter. Can anyone clarify this?
2. I added the course to my cart and it said it's 14usd per month? Can anyone clarify if this is the real price?
3. Can you finish this course in 2 months? I'm jobless so maybe I can focus on this course alone. Is it feasible? Sorry if I'm asking this but as I stated above, I am completely broke and I might even loan some money from someone and hope I have enough to sustain myself during this course. As much as possible I'd like to complete the course in 2 months max or maybe 2.

My second billing cycle starts on the 27th of July. Great, I thought - I could finish the last course before my second billing cycle, so I wouldn't have to pay twice. I finished the first 2 courses of the spec in 3 days, because I already had graduate level math and computer science knowledge, so the content was not difficult to follow.

Today I go to check up on the release date for Course 3, and to my surprise, **it has been moved to the same exact day of my second billing cycle.** I understand if maybe there's some assignments that are bugged and need to be fixed, or if something came up that delayed the release. But may I also say that this essentially screws early students over, as they have to pay twice to finish the last part of the course in order to complete the spec.

There's practically no incentive for me to pay another 40-something to complete 1-3 days worth of content.

1445,t3_vqkf5n,IBM AI Engineering Final Course Problem(AI Capstone Project part),"I liked the course but the final part of it is simply outrageous. You had to choose between TensorFlow and Keras to do the final project, I chose Keras as I understood it better through the course. The problem is that, for the 4 weeks of the final course, you had to download a zipped folder containing 20.000 photos of concrete for Image Analysis and Training.

After downloading, you had to extract it, that was the first problem, it said it should take a few minutes, but, even connect directly to my internet via the Ethernet cable, it took more than 5 hours to extract the entire folder. Note that my internet, while not the best of them all, is still average.

Another problem, that is making me unable to move forward, is training the model on week 3, it has 2 epochs and it took, too, 5 hours to train only the first epoch, and, after all that, it still got stuck and doesn't move to the second Epoch.

I thought it was fine, it was just for learning after all, but the thing is you need the model for the final part of the course, that is, you need to download the trained model and use it comparing it to the model you will make in the project. So, I am currently stuck in the course, which is quite sad because, even if I learned what I had to learn, I would like the certificate. I will have to cancel the course if it reaches the day of the next payment, as 50 Dollars is still pretty expensive in my country, not to count the fees you have to pay because it is an international payment.",7,1.0,/r/coursera/comments/vqkf5n/ibm_ai_engineering_final_course_problemai/,coursera

you just insert the code while creating account.

(2)Then you need to create Object Storage.

Lecturer told it as IBM Object Storage, But it is actually called Object Storage in current version of IBM Cloud.

(3)You should launch IBM Watson Studio

The Web UI interface that the lecturer explains is different with current version of IBM Cloud.

So you just need to start with Watson Studio of IBM Cloud.

&amp;#x200B;

(4)if you want to connect GitHub by project base.

Go to IBM watson studio

and click your project and it will show Manage menu on top

and click Services &amp; integrations

and click Third party integrations

and insert your Branch path(it is on the Code menu of your Project page of GitHub)

and you must 'master' branch in your GitHub before doing this.

So go to Code -&gt; branches -&gt; New Branch button -&gt; insert 'master' branch

1508,t3_v4iufe,The peer review system is a joke,"I've had my reservations about this system while I was starting off with some courses on Coursera, I've always felt that the logic behind the system has some flaws and there is a high likelihood that the system would be abused.

Having a peer review is an asset when it comes to university-level assignments but an anonymous peer review system is often plagued by bad actors and taking into consideration the ease of accessibility in Coursera, it would prove a hindrance to hard-workers like myself who face issues with the completion of certain courses.

My skepticism was well-founded because I've been held back since a few days due to bad peer reviews which seem to be targeted against me. In certain cases, I find people who purposely sabotage others' reviews by blindly rating them the bare minimum, jeopardizing the total average and in other cases I've found people who were stealing existing peer submissions. (which could not be even ruled out by plagiarizm checkers, as the original content was unique).

I've completed 12+ peer reviews over the past 2-3 days, out of which I received at least 4-5 blatant plagiarizations, 4-5 with missing attachments and 4-5 completely irrelevant, in some cases I received the same assignments twice.

I've had some initial suspicions which are more or less confirmed now, the double submissions happen when the other peer resubmits another person's assignment as their own. In such cases, it's hard to know who the original submission belongs to because the peer reviews run on an anonymous system (even if it didn't, you wouldn't be aware of whose submission came first due to the absence of timestamps) hence I had no option but to grade both of them accordingly (in the two cases I faced, it was an exceptionally well-written description totaling to around 4-5 pages)

FYI the course I'm stuck on is Principles of Management by JHU. In any case, I'll just resubmit my existing assignment after improving upon it (I already think it covers all of the requirements though), and work on other courses in the meantime.   


Coursera really needs to ramp up their abuse checks on the peer review platform, or work on an easier alternative for it (possibly automating AI grading). Anything is better that being left at the mercy of anons.",38,0.96,/r/coursera/comments/v4iufe/the_peer_review_system_is_a_joke/,coursera

I signed up for a subscription based course 3 months ago via Coursera. I am trying to cancel the subscription, but nothing shows up in My Purchases Tab. It doesn't show that I am enrolled in the course at all, and nothing shows up in My Purchases. They are definitely charging me, I can see the Coursera charges on my bank statement. I have tried to see if I may have set up multiple accounts, but I haven't. I am concerned because there is no way to contact a rep at Coursera for help, no email or phone number. There is a number associated with Coursera for the charge on my bank statement, but I tried calling that number and it is an inactive line. Feeling concerned as I have no way to cancel this subscription? How can they not have any contact information for the company available?!

1573,t3_u67suy,Frustrations with Peer-Review Assignments,"Hello all,

I've had some rather frustrating encounters through the peer reviewed assignments, particularly for my Google Project Certificate in the final course, Capstone: Real World Scenarios. This last course contains 8 different peer review assignments, and my goodness, passing through them has sometimes been like climbing the rocky face of a mountain. 

Everytime, I made sure my submission objectively completed all of the requirements, and if something was left up to obscurity, I've always included a note to clarify a point to whoever is grading me. In several cases though, I've been failed outright by random people. 

In one case, I completed the assignment, and one user failed me. What was their feedback? 

""Lol!"" 

Lol? Laugh out loud? For a moment, I thought about laughing at the absurdity of it. Eventually, I just had to sigh and resubmit. I resubmitted several days ago, and I'm still awaiting a new grade, which of course, means more subscription money down the drain. 

To be fair, part of the blame lies on me, I could be more proactive and make a post on the forums for a new review, but I haven't done that. I take ownership for it, but needless to say, the grade irritated me.

In another case, I had one user fail me because they ""couldn't access my file"". This was kind of funny, because the other user who reviewed me had no issues in looking over my work. I suspect they clicked the ""https://www.com"" link instead of simply scolling down to the submitted file. 

Now, at first this was fine, because I resubmitted and was passed, but it gets even better. 

Tonight, actually just a few minutes ago, I submitted a new assignment after making sure all was well. It failed completely! Guess why! 

The same user from before said they ""couldn't access the file"", and yet, the other user who reviewed me had no problems accessing the file once again and gave me full marks. 

Now, what makes this even more frustrating, is despite the fact that the other user gave me full marks, the system counts the entire thing as a fail because it ties with the lowest point given. How does that figure?

Sorry, this has turned into quite a rant. 

All to say, has anyone else experienced this? I'm to the point where while I have appreciated this program and the service, I would not recommend it to anyone else from these experiences. Even a simple fail can set you back days, and you have very little control over it, compounded with the fact that there is understandably no quality control filter for grades. 

Whew.

Thank you for reading this, and I sincerely hope you have a good day,

I want to start with Google IT Support.  I'm at the point where it wants me on a desktop OS.  I understand parts of the program will use Linux, parts will use Windows.  I don't know whether I should use two devices, one with dual boot, one with a VM, or one using WSL.  I don't know what my needs will be and wish the course would spell that out for me before I go and spend any money.  

I have a nearly 0.5kwh capacity ""power bank"" with a standard 3 prong AC outlet that should be able to charge a laptop battery multiple times, so I don't necessarily need to use the car to power whatever I end up using

Ergonomically speaking, because I despise using laptops in car seats, here's what I think would do well:
An external battery powered screen (they look like tablets) (unless there's a tablet properly that meets all my other needs for the course) that I can mount to the ceiling to be viewed only when I recline.  A keyboard on my lap unless I can fandangle an ergonomic angled keyboard tray situation.  A mouse.... Somewhere.  I hate using a mouse while lying on a back, doing it in a car sounds terrible.  I might just want to get proficient at using a track ball or something.

If there's a tablet that meets all the other needs, that would be the simplest in terms of physical implementation.

1582,t3_u3imqb,"Don't take mastertrack courses, specifically from University of Michigan","I want to start by saying, the professors and program managers are so unorganised. For paying $2500USD I would expect more.

The cohorts start at random, so if you sign up, you may not actually be able to start many of the beginner classes until a few weeks later.

The class has a slack channel, but they are often unresponsive or unhelpful. Many students would barely take the effort to questions and pass, where as I put time and effort citing sources, and I would get a low grade because I didn't put some fictional story around my essay. They wanted some BS like ""I woke up in the morning and couldn't go wait to meet the environment council of my city...""

And mix my urban environmental plan into a fictional story. What a waste of time.

Anyways, I finished the course after one year, where they said it would take 4-6 months. It didn't take me longer because of my lagging, its because of their dysfunctional way of running the courses.

Now, it's been two months and with multiple correspondence with Coursera and UofM they have yet to materialise my final mastertrak certificate. They keep saying they are ""investigating""

I've already missed the deadline to use it for another school that was willing to accept my completion, and I've also missed the deadline to get a reimbursement from one of my sponsors after completion.

The sponsor was already understanding of the disorganised mess and that it took twice as long to complete, but two months after completion with no certificate,  they had to withdraw the offer.

\&gt;ANSWER TO MY POST:   
Due to the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine Coursera has decided to suspend all courses that have ties to Russia. This course was not developed by HSE University, a university based in Moscow.   
Here is Courseras official report: [https://blog.coursera.org/coursera-response-to-the-humanitarian-crisis-in-ukraine/](https://blog.coursera.org/coursera-response-to-the-humanitarian-crisis-in-ukraine/)  


\&gt; MY THOUGHTS:  
I am not sure about everyone else but I personally did not receive an email from Coursera about this, I had to go find this blog instead. I was worried I had done something wrong... The reasons Coursera has are their own and that is fine. But please send out an email to students informing them of this decision with a simple link to your blog. I wouldn't have been on Reddit asking this then :/

&amp;#x200B;

IT degree program. Today, I was just working on my first peer-graded assignment on a course offered by the University of Colorado (Database Management Essentials) that I have to take for my Information Management course.

The assignment was to make CREATE TABLE statements for an inter-college athletics organization and show screenshots of the populated tables. I've spent the whole day working on the assignment on my own and giving my blood, sweat, and tears only to find out that I received a message that my grade has been overridden and that I will not get any credit from it because they said I was committing plagiarism.

It might be tempting to blame me for not thinking this through, but I first thought the solution to the problem was to fix the similarity percentages by replacing the offending part (the written code) with a screenshot of the code and move the captions over to the documents. Still, it says grade overridden.

After talking to my dad about it, I decided to leave a message for my college professor handling the Information Management subject about it, and I also tried contacting support, either by replying to said message or by sending a case to the help center.

I had no intent of committing plagiarism yet they said I did. What could I do, aside from just comply with the checker before submitting?

I just noticed that while it says I'm subscribed at $39 for The Business of Music Production, the two (2) courses are also part of a different specialization offered by the same company (Berklee Online) - ""Music Business Specialization"". I would like to get the specialization for this. 

When I'm done with the two (2) courses, can I switch over to Music Business Specialization and have my progress from the Business of Music Production carry over (same courses!), or should I resubscribe now to that Music Business and do the courses from scratch there?

It feels pretty bad to get bad reviews like that after completely working on my own. Even many of the students get passed on the assignment based on the partial code or downloading someone else's artifacts . I highly doubt about the verification of the peer graded assignments and strictly like to suggest [Coursera](https://www.linkedin.com/company/coursera/) as a this\* learning place where they don't want to give specialization certifications to the students. It's a pity on the organization. [Udemy](https://www.linkedin.com/company/udemy/) ,[Great Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/company/great-learning/)  &amp; other learning platforms are far better than your bull-this\*. You teach lectures full of pity and expect students to complete the whole assessment based on those lectures. One has to always take help of other learning resources to get their work done. But that doesn't mean copying code and judging someone for violation .Even the contact support keeps on telling that this can't be fixed. Is it a joke or something else? Shame on this platform for these acts. Here's the plagiarized report to my code.

I am seeking general advice for re-entering the learning sphere. I am going to take Google's Data Analysis Specialization. I will have Coursera Plus, there are a few other courses I may take in tandem but this one will be my main goal to complete.

1) What things (materials, programs, applications, reading suggestions) will I need to set my self up for success before I press that enroll button? 
     - So far I have note taking materials, a new beefy laptop with Windows OS and Office 365

2) Are there any tips you have for using the Coursera site itself?

3) Are there any concerns with this Specialization in particular that I should be aware of?

If these have already been answered elsewhere I am researching this reddit for posts but I thought I'd reach out fresh and see if there was anything new to know.

As the title suggests, do I have to put 'Coursera' on my LinkedIn as the issuing organization, or is it alright to put the college that administered the content? Obviously, the latter looks a lot better and I think it makes more sense as it exhibits what school you got the certificate from.

I just have to vent somewhere, so apologies it's here. I want people to be aware of what's happening, and actually even think twice before paying for this service. 

I've decided to try Coursera with Google Project Management ""professional certificate"". In order to get the certificate, you have to complete 5 or 6 courses, each with graded assignments. The problem is - the assignments are graded by other Coursera users.

Now, i've completed all but one courses, and was always receiving passing grades - it worked well. I am now working on my last course (Capstone) in the certification path, which has a lot of graded assingments. Unfortunately, most of them are getting failed almost immediately. 

S​imple example from today - I've submitted my Week 3 submission, and  got a failed grade within 30 minutes. Two assessors - one graded me with  max points (criteria are clear, and not subjective), the other, ""Jay  Thakar"", gave me 0 points at each, with feedback ""bad"".

Let me repeat - the grading criteria are very clear, and not subjective at all. You either clearly do get a point in particular criteria, or you don't. 

​I'm just annoyed to no end, as it's my 3rd ""failed"" assingment in Capstone, with completely no grounds for having it failed. And I have to pay a hefty subscription fee to actually bother with resubmitting and begging for reviews, as it seems that after failing, the submission goes to a black hole. After my first failed submission, I had to wait almost a week to get re-assessed again... 

I'm just frustrated, and will not recommend Coursera to anyone, and will happily forget about the experience as soon as I'm done with this certification.

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone is considering the $40 subscription course, Google PM certification - please do think twice, and save yourself some frustration.

Get  free access to any standalone course, Specialization, or Professional  Certificate from Google Cloud. Offer valid through November 6, 2021. No  limit per learner.

The promotional page ([https://www.coursera.org/promo/google-cloud-free-courses-2021](https://www.coursera.org/promo/google-cloud-free-courses-2021)) promised that ***Standalone courses free for 180 days from enrollment.*** *Specialization/Professional Certificates are free for 1st month.*

The page contains lots of specializations (contain several courses) and solo courses; I tried applying various but **all of them always ask for a credit card!**

I have carefully studied the Terms and conditions for this promotion ([https://www.coursera.support/s/article/Google-Cloud-promotion?language=en\_US](https://www.coursera.support/s/article/Google-Cloud-promotion?language=en_US)) and it said:

*standalone courses would be free for 180 days and* ***do not require any credit card.***

Well, I tried to apply to over 20 different courses (both ones that are part of certificates or specializations, or that are listed as just a ""course""... nothing works. They ask for the credit card all the time, and never mention any 180 days period - only **30 days**.

I have tried accessing the list of ""eligible courses"" listing from another link from T&amp;Cs, but no change. The T&amp;Cs mention 100000 users limit per a course, but I haven't seen any that would come to this threshold (only one had 99800 and after you press enroll the number changes to ""17800 enrolled"").

I'm completely confused and disappointed because I was unable to claim even a SINGLE course from many offered by this promotion! Many of them are interesting, and the deadline to claim is November 6.

I couldn't find any option to chat with the support.

I have been subscribing to Coursera  ([www.coursera.org](https://www.coursera.org/)) for years and now they emailed the following canceling access to the courses I've previously taken. I have continued paying for my Cousera subscription for three+ years now, and am ""locked into"" this content and reference it frequently. **I thank Cousera for the high quality content and quality.** The [deeplearning.ai](https://deeplearning.ai) specialization in particular was instrumental for me.

That being said, Cousera is now **canceling all prior subscriptions** and forcing them to pair for individual courses.

\- This feels like an  unfair practice -- **IMO, prior users should be grandfathered and have the opportunity to keep their current subscription model.** (If the user cancels that subscription it would be expired and no longer available)

Would love to hear some thoughts from the community!

Till about the past 3-4 years we were really grinding to make sure we survived but thankfully we’re profitable now. It’s only now that we can take a step back and try fix issues with efficiency within the business and major issues. We have had a long history of staff stealing from us and they’ve all been very big amounts over the time they’ve worked with us and they’ve taken money and stock and kind of create their own ecosystem in the stores, they get to run it how the want when we are not present. What I am looking for is if there are any courses online or in person (in Ireland) on how to get proper systems and procedures in place for stores like ours. Right now we all run around 7 days a week trying to sort out staffing/ stock/ equipment issues and everything inbetween. If I could do a course to try get everything streamlined it would really help our family not be devoured by the business.

2. Would it be harder to gain employment with an online degree?

3. Assuming I complete the degree with top grades, would an online degree be considered for a scholarship if I'm pursuing a Masters degree in any other university/college?

4. Is it hard to complete the degree in 3 years? Can I not possibly cram it in 2 years if I want to, since it's self-paced? 

5. Speaking as a strictly average/above-average student, would I have a reasonable chance to get in if I applied right now, considering that the deadline is 13th, I believe, and that I don't have any evidence of my english language skills except for the english language course in GCE O'levels, though I'm not sure if that's enough?
Although I did attempt an SAT (1390 - 700 English, 690 Mathematics) 3 years ago, I don't think they'd accept it since SAT's are exclusively for American institutions, or so I've heard.

I'm asking this as a CS major undergrad student currently enrolled in a University that is notorious for having THE MOST toughest curriculum to follow in the entire country by far, with its students having mental breakdowns by the end of each semester. I'm in my 3rd year so I've gotten (somewhat) used to it. Additionally, I live in a third world country so... Obligatory mental health is a joke and the more you suffer, the stronger you get.

The plus point is that when it comes to employment, even the dumbest barely-passer from my uni would be considered over an above-average grader from literally any other college (over here at least), AND that the biggest software firm in my country is run by alumni from my university so our fresh graduates have even more preference to the point where pretty much all of the developers there are graduates of my uni. That's a pretty big plus imo (considering the unemployment rate here, its a third world country so you can probably guess) but not sure if it's something one would willingly wreck their mental health over.

I guess I went on a little tangent there, but the main point is that I am confident that I can handle a good amount of stress with no problems.

The reason as to why I wish to start over is that, well its mainly because I fucked up my 1st and 2nd semester due to ongoing mental health problems and personal life mostly... Since then I've struggled to improve my grades and only ended up maintaining them. Even with these grades I don't believe I'll have to struggle much to get employment, but it's going to be tough pursuing a Masters Degree with my current grades, especially if I want a scholarship/financial aid (which I do since my family isn't that well off)

Your input is appreciated. Thank you for reading

1966,t3_pib8ux,Some questions about courses and speed,"So, i signed up using financial aid to three python courses, Ive learned python before from YouTube, so I expected it to be easy, but due to unforeseen events In life i might not have time to watch all the videos thru thuroughly.

I know how to do everything in the courses, and honestly I just want a certificate to prove I know how to code in python, but I'm worried that if I only do the assignments then the course will flag me for cheating since it would be very suspicious to do the assignments without even learning anything from the course.

What do I do? Do I need to worry about the speed? Can I cancel two courses and keep my position in the course? (It said that I cant complete the course after a certain deadline)

1967,t3_pi7g7m,What are your thoughts about GTC Community and its Agreements?,"I have just read the GTC Agreement and it doesn't feel right to me. Not being paid is okay. Working for no money as long as it may help learners around the world access awesome courses is fine. But, Coursera demands so much more than that, even when it doesn't pay you. It can remove your translations before they can come to learners, and also, it can remove at ANY TIME it wants without any reason. It says by agreeing to this agreement, it has every right to reject and remove translations at any time and with no or any reasons and in its sole discretion, without even telling the translators!? So rude and unfair, I think! And it also indicates that no Confidential Information can be used for any purpose other than providing translations and related content to Coursera? So, I can't even use it for my study and for writing essays in school like normal study materials? (Maybe, I have taken it too seriously but it's still so...urgh). It didn't give the translators even ONE benefit... And there are also some sayings ""Coursera may terminate this Agreement or discontinue this program, or remove, edit, or alter your translation and/or limit your participation in or access to the program at any time and for any or NO reason according to its SOLE discretion."" It's like you are someone who cooks but has the 'right' to eat NOTHING. Also, Coursera can use translators' names to promote the GTC program!? And more Coursera owns all rights to the translations!? I feel so sad, and I don't even want to read the rest of the agreement...

1971,t3_pfkysr,Coursera's Discord Server: Coursera Cafe,"Hey everyone, I recently discovered a Discord server dedicated to Coursera learners. I wanted to share this with you because I believe linking Coursera users across the world can enhance our learning. Here are some benefits:

* Meet Coursera learners from all over the world, some possibly taking the same course as you
* Discuss topics of interest in various disciplines, such as arts &amp; humanities, social sciences, STEM, and personal development.
* Join a community with peers and people who value learning
* Host study groups
* Talk about anything including, but not limited to, Coursera and other MOOCs.

I'm currently taking a few humanities courses on Coursera, and I see that discussion forums are rather limited in offering interactions among classmates. I hope that we can emulate a classroom in one way, that is to allow learners to be a part of an uplifting and like-minded, yet diverse community.

What is the point of signing up and then cheating and not learning anything? I have seen 2 Indian YT Channels that flat out give the answers and I bet there are a lot on other sites. The students' excuses are like, ""I didn't know I couldn't use someone else's work."" or ""It just happens to look like that website and uses techniques not taught in the class."" I am glad that Coursera seems to stay strong and not give these cheaters second chances. I think they should be banned sitewide too. How dishonest of a person to you have to be to cheat on MOOC classes that have unlimited time, resources to check, and are introductory in general.

2022,t3_owzhn7,Looking for courses to get with programming,"Hello  


I'm currently taking the Python 3 Programming Specialization (Link: [https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python-3-programming](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python-3-programming))  
along with 2 other specializations:  
1. Guitar Specialization (For a hobby)  
2. Academic English: Writing  


I lost interest with the Academic English: Writing Specialization because it shifted more on writing academic and research papers. I really only enrolled in it thinking it would help me write better formal emails etc.  


So now I'm looking for a Specialization or Course I can take with my Python Programming Specialization. The guitar one is just a hobby and it does not consume much of my time.  


Just a short background about me:  
I graduated with an engineering degree last 2020 amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the pandemic, I was hesitant to find work because they mostly offered work-on-site jobs. So fast forward to now, I chose to study different things on Coursera to learn new skills to help me find a more suitable job in the future when the pandemic calms down.   


TL:DR:  
I'm unenrolling one of my specializations to find one that would preferably be related or complement my Python Programming Specialization in hope for a better career in the future.",3,1.0,/r/coursera/comments/owzhn7/looking_for_courses_to_get_with_programming/,coursera

2024,t3_owc2in,Stats with R Course,"I'm doing a course on Stats with R and about to finish the final project soon. I honestly think the course is utter crap and I'm not planning on paying for any in the future. For reference, this is the course I am talking about:  


[https://www.coursera.org/learn/probability-intro/home/](https://www.coursera.org/learn/probability-intro/home/week/1)  


First off, how do you get off teaching a class with an R specialization without even explaining some of the most basic operators and functions of R first? Well they've managed to do it here. As a result, I had to dig around the internet for several days to learn some of the core functions of R that should have been taught by this class. For example, you're not even taught how to properly use the R scripts other than how to knit them in R Markdown. Instead, you are mostly taught to use the bottom console. It would have been far more useful to learn how to write scripts from the beginning, given you can easily edit, copy, paste, etc. with the code.   


While we are on that subject, I wasn't taught anything that I actually wanted to learn R for...things like the t-test, ANOVA, CFA, etc. Instead you just learn how to do random stuff like pnorm functions and how to filter variables (or how to run dplr without explaining why the piping function '%&gt;%' matters). As much as its good to brush up on the basics like histograms and boxplots, the core tests that are extremely common and useful to learn are to my great amazement missing. Idk how you can run a stats course without even a single explanation of a t-test.  


During the various times I was confused by the teaching, I would normally refer to my book, but the book chapters they give you literally never align with what you're learning that week, which is astounding given the whole point of a book is for reference.  I checked to make sure I had the most recent book, and even with having the most up to date text, its completely disconnected from the video content.  


You're better off finding courses that are similar on places like Khan Academy or just YouTubing whatever you wanna learn (which is basically what I did since it was free and much easier to understand).  


P.S. I didn't figure out until later that the whole stats program they run is part of a broader package. The whole reason they don't have any of the crap you wanna learn in the beginning is because its stretched out to multiple courses that slowly bleed you of the money you need to subscribe over time.",6,0.88,/r/coursera/comments/owc2in/stats_with_r_course/,coursera

I am considering to take ""Google UX Design Professional Certificate"" ([https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-ux-design](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-ux-design)), yet as I am going through a very hard period financially speaking. I am not sure if I would be able to complete all courses in this certificate program in one month, since it is (appx) +220 hours. I've already applied for financial aid, and did not hear back yet. But, as far as I know, it is only for the first course of the program, and I have to apply individually for all courses under this certificate program.  


So, my question is this: What happens if I audit all courses in this professional certificate program, then subscribe, complete all other requirements that I have no access as a auditee? Would I be able to gain this certificate?

I really enjoyed this course and love how it helps me see what I'm doing correctly and wrong for learning better.

It makes no sense that I can't in some way hide the things I don't want to see.

And an unrelated issue: My Saved Courses tab has disappeared. In the past, I had saved several courses. But now I can't find where they're saved. When I first log in, (the ""Welcome Back"" screen), I have Home, In Progress, and Completed --&gt; and for an instant, I see a fourth (Saved) -- and then it disappears. It's like an element loads and then unloads a second later. This also makes no sense and is really frustration.

Lumping them all together just clogs the discussion forums with either peer-review requests or the recurring instructor-created discussions. If you intend to get anything productive out of these forums, tough luck.

I'd also argue that the recurring instructor-created discussions is unnecessary. One big post and everyone answering on the same post should be enough. There is no reason to clog up the discussion forums with the same post. Furthermore, many of these have blank answers like "" "", ""."", or ""done"".

I'm breezing through the first course which is supposed to take 5 weeks, probably gonna finish it in 1 or 2 weeks. Then I'll apply for the second course, having to wait 2 weeks while doing nothing until I receive approval. If I do this for each of the 7 remaining courses I'd have almost like 2 months of empty time just waiting and letting knowledge slowly drain from my brain while I wait lol.

So basically my question is: can I apply for financial aid for multiple courses at once? Even if I haven´t yet completed the previous courses in order?

My guess would be nothing, so I hope this takes fire before the IPO so that they have an interest in fixing the issue.

I think Coursera is great and Andrew Ng is fantastic, but let me tell you that: given their position in this space, they should expect something more from their staff. It is not good enough.

If I were a University I would be concerned about the dilution of my brand value by making available specializations on that platform.

I am engaged in a specialization where for each Course I need to review 3 submissions. I use Grammarly paid subscription which has a plagiarism feature: 4/5 submissions are copypasta, 99% of them from some guys in we all know which country.

What happens next is unknown, but I am also waisting my time reviewing losers copypasting with zero effort, and this stops me from finishing my courses as well.

This should stop.

It would make a lot of difference for everyone if employers could rely on the Coursera accreditations just a little bit more, otherwise, they should just drop altogether the option to buy certificates as they add no value.

I hope they could re-scan all the submitted materials (it's 2021, it is an easy task), look for plagiarism, invalidate the already issued accreditations and go out with some big statement about this. ",2,1.0,/r/coursera/comments/m7n5zz/plagiarism_issues_please_do_something/,coursera

My understanding is that after seven days I will be charged something like $50 per month. Paying $400 for the course hardly seem free to me. Am I missing something?

I thought I'd ask before creating an account. Thanks.",1,1.0,/r/coursera/comments/m0q5od/free_certificate_course/,coursera
2235,t3_m0m6dw,IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate - Frustrating,"Really looking to transfer skills into a new career, mainly jr. data analyst style position. Took a month to learn (self-taught via youtube, github, online courses) various foundations in python, MySQL, Excel, Cognos, and then dove a bit deeper into pandas, numpy and matplotlib. 

Decided enough self-taught learning, i needed to actually put everything together and i signed up for and paid to do the  IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate course. 

Great content in the beginning. Perfect learning pace, practice exercises, everything was going great. Then, the course decides to go completely rogue and get into things that I feel are completely out of the scope of data analytics, and fully into data science. 

This is where my main frustration comes in at, is the capstone project. The final assignment to gain the full certificate (a major reason for my signing up for he course) focuses on so many things that I feel like i did not learn during the multiple courses. I have spent almost 3 weeks going back and re-watching videos, re-doing hands-on labs, reading material, etc. Still, having a huge issue trying to understand what the capstone project even wants, let alone how to produce it. 

While i appreciate the knowledge gained along the way, it makes me feel like I am not able to enter into this field of work because I cant even complete this project.

2236,t3_lz1zy2,Coursera Writing and Editing--is it worth it?,"Hi all. I just applied to qualify for financial aid for the Writing and Editing: Word Choice and Word Order course hosted by the University of Michigan. I've worked as an RPG editor but lack a degree or certificate in that field. While I do plan to get one, due to financial reasons I intend to take this course as a sort of stepping stone first.

I was wondering if this course would be something useful to add to my resume until I can attend college, or if I should save my time and money for an editing certificate later on.",4,0.75,/r/coursera/comments/lz1zy2/coursera_writing_and_editingis_it_worth_it/,coursera

I’m a complete noob when it comes to Coursera and more generally online education. So I was wondering; when trying to find a job and handing out resumes, are online degrees from Coursera and certifications regarded as almost equivalent to traditional degrees or do some companies simply don’t consider online degrees at all?
