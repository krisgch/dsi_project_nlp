1,t3_xxluk0,edX,"Not necessarily. Assignments are only for certificate students, and when creating a course it’s possible to restrict individual course pages to certificate students only. Some courses I’ve been involved with have about 10-15% of the material unavailable to auditors."
2,t3_xtm1ea,edX,"You can just access archived courses even if not enrolled, but not purchase anymore or do graded assignments"
3,t3_xsaqli,edX,Cs50 python is more about learning the python language and is probably easier. It has less explanations though and reasoning about computer science. Cs50 teaches you more about theory and would make you a better programmer. You also learn some python in cs50. I’d recommend doing both and cs50 first.
4,t3_xseepw,edX,"I’m taking it. I don’t like it but I will complete it. Seems like a mediocre course to push their ibm cloud platform which isn’t very popular in the industry, but might be if you want an ibm job. 

At the same time you will gain some knowledge and understanding of how cloud applications work.

It does not teach coding in any shape or form. So if you need to learn coding, you must do it elsewhere. You may be able to take the course without much coding knowledge, most things seem to be cut and paste (keep in mind I have experience in most of the languages they used so I might be overstating).

Overall I have been underwhelmed by all ibm edX courses so far."

13,t3_wztpeg,edX,"I feel it would (I'm doing it), as it can show a potential employer that you are taking the initiative to learn what you need for the job you want (and if you don't have a background in the field, it helps build a background)"

26,t3_wic5h5,edX,Just do one of them. No need to do a ton of research. I did CS50 (the original) and 6.00.1x. Both excellent starting points.
27,t3_wh18dn,edX,I was actually looking at this course to refresh my abilities with programming before starting my masters. What YouTube resources would you say are better than the two intro courses?
28,t3_w5rry2,edX,"I believe im doing the same one, the UC San Diego Micromasters Program: Data Science. 

Its made of 4 courses. I've completede the first 3, missing the 4th, so cant say anyting about it. 

If its the same program, then you basically sign up to the first course, complete it, whenever yo have time, you sign up for the next, and so forth. 

When you complete you get a citificate of completion i think? I did with other multi-course things i've done on edx.

I think so far i've spend a year doing it slowly. I believe a single course would take up a lot of your time for 2-3 months, if you only have the nights.

Probability and statistics has been the worst of them so far."
29,t3_w3khh6,edX,"I did that and when I saw the difficult of both courses I unenrolled on the statistics. I highly recommend you to do so in until the deadline to do that having a refund. To get a refund you have to unenroll until the date they inform.
The course of probability seem easy at the beginning but the difficult escalate quickly. And a good resource to aid you is the playlist of the probability course on YouTube."
30,t3_w3j4fb,edX,I don't think you'll require any maths for it. They teach you some probability and statistics in the course itself. Basic high school stuff is more than enough.

Employers want skilled workers that continue to learn - the style is really not the important part."
40,t3_vq8xf8,edX,"In short, no"
41,t3_vpn2rt,edX,Just give an intro to yourself .then mention your income or your parents income and how purchasing the course for the original price would be a financial burden on you.Elaborate the financial part thoroughly .Answer the other questions like how this course would help you and how you've prepared  for the course beforehand.They are lenient with discounts and you'd be sure to get it.You'd get 90 percent discount if it approves .if you have any other queries feel free to dm.
42,t3_vo9eo3,edX,Those dates are just recommendations to keep you on track. You just need to complete before audit access expires.
43,t3_vhp11b,edX,"Could you tell us more about this course?
Is it from a university, for example?

My general experience is that the first week takes a month or two, but it gets better from there."
44,t3_vhaoii,edX,The email will only be sent for the actual proctored exam.
45,t3_vfm1bc,edX,"If the content on the whiteboard had nothing to do with the exam, they'll probably not do anything. But I can't say for sure. 
Just saying there shouldn't be any reason to cancel your exam. However, I would suggest that you be careful about errors like these in the future."
46,t3_vejti8,edX,"I'd doubt it affects your enrollment in the future. It's possible the TA is just trying to clean up the roster and because you haven't touched it, it looks like you signed up but never followed through. Edx does have comprehensive metrics , so it does affect the courses ""success metrics"" if they have dud enrollments because it lowers their participation rates and rates of completion."
47,t3_vbrscn,edX,"I do not believe the certificates themselves provide *that much* value to the CV. What is better to add is projects and so on made using what you have learned.

A way I recommend is best for this is take the homework/projects within these courses, do them to pass the stages, but also in a separate file take the techniques and solve a different similar problem, and perhaps even extend it.

Example: suppose 'introduction to programming' gives you problems with csv files where you are plotting some financial data and computing means etc.

Then a smart 'new' project using this material is to find a data API such as yfinance or federal reserve API to compute some things with their data. You will find you have to be a lot smarter than with the 'perfect' data sets in a university course as you will have to remove lines with missing data, strange shapes of arrays, and so on. This is where the real learning happens."
48,t3_vb0aot,edX,"Did you ended up taking the course?

51,t3_v1k44q,edX,How do you see this information?
52,t3_v0rvls,edX,Yes. Done it many times.
53,t3_uy4rbm,edX,"The main difference between them is, that in Coursera by applying for financial aid you can get the whole course for free but in EDX it is not free, you have to pay some price. However, you can still get some discount on EDX by following a specific procedure."
54,t3_uxh33y,edX,"I would say both would have zero impact on your CV. These courses can be enrolled by anyone.

66,t3_uc9z7n,edX,"KNOWLEDGE IS FREE NOT CERTIFICATE.

You can do courses for free but will not allowed to take graded exams and therefore will not receive official credits or certificates.

68,t3_tmtph6,edX,"I don't know which country you are but just enjoy your time in high school and do the learning for fun! University courses have some differences with edx or other same companies courses! Also, finding a job in future has more to do with networking than knowledge. I think instead of going deep into the field of study, try different things. For example I saw that Python developing is quite useful in not only software engineering but also in other fields so it would be good idea to learn it from YouTube. The other thing is asking this question in a better place may be more beneficial for you. Find some expert in the field you want to study and ask them."
69,t3_tes02u,edX,"I did! I applied for financial aid for a course in a MITx MicroMasters course, explained why the program was going to benefit my career, and they approved a 90% financial aid coverage - I ended up paying about $20 for the course."

84,t3_shzlsw,edX,"It should be said on each course specifically.

MIT's uMaster S&amp;DS is ""instructor-led on a schedule"", which means you have assignments with deadlines. (week to week, and each course they tell you how much time is expected each week, which is around 12 hours average I think)

The professional certificate you showed writes specifically ""self paced"", so no week-to-week deadline there, just at your own pace."
85,t3_sgf5us,edX,"You can audit a course means you will not get course certificate but will get knowledge.

87,t3_seubce,edX,"Did both courses and highly recommend. Whether you want to pay for a verified certificate is up to you. If it is cheaper to buy separately do that you still get the professional certificate. I did it this way just because I did the games one a year or more later. I would double check the prices though, they may have increased the cost for a course, it’s unusual to be more expensive to do the bundle."
88,t3_sd7w0a,edX,I started in the data science MM due to its ability to apply toward a data science masters at Harvard Extension School but ended up switching to the supply chain management MM to go for the Sustainability masters. The statistical modeling class just started in the last two years as it wasn't an option to pick when I took the data analysis class. I would highly recommend taking the statistical modeling and computation class as the other class was an absolute mess.

What next course would you recommend if you wanted to keep learning to code? I wanted to keep going and go either Machine Learning or Blockchain, but mainly to be literate, and not to ""one day write a ML program"". I just can't see myself doing it.

98,t3_rp64at,edX,"Hi! I just finished the first of four courses that are part of the program. The first one, and I think the others are similar, lasted 3.5 months with average 10-14 hours a week that a student needs to spend on it. 

I'd recommend you to start with one course first and see whether you stick to it, you can even start with a free version that doesn't provide a certificate. Machine learning with python certainly required college level calculus and some stochastic. Luckily in the end of January there are two courses starting, statistics and probability theory. I could skip it because I already have a master's degree in mathematics but I don't know how much you have seen in undergrad economy. 

You should probably be able to finish the four courses until 2024 taking one course per term, maybe even faster if you have more time on your hands. I don't know how the final exam is scheduled though. 

Feel free to ask further questions!"

I had lined up a few professional certificate programs that I was going to take for the year but when it came time to enroll and pay for them I decided to check the individual courses first. Many turned out to be ending next month so I never would've been able to earn the certificates in time, and some of the courses in the programs were already archived. Yet, I was one click away from paying for the whole program with nothing to stop me or prompt me otherwise.

So I had to change my plans and miss out on 2 prof.cert. programs that I was really excited about taking. But the main concern that I had was what if I didn't see the end dates and archived courses in time? I would just be sitting in the program until new sessions become available, or I would've just wasted my money.. They should really do something to avoid this. and/or you should be able to get a refund."

Also I feel like coursera offers more “trendy” classes, like the ones recently came out by google. 

And the coursera payment system, basically the subscription model, surprisingly works better for me. 

So yeah now I’m mostly only using coursera.."
151,t3_nvwzqi,edX,"I guess it’s technically possible- I can’t see why it wouldn’t be. I would just be careful not to overload yourself. Don’t put too much of a strain and pressure (time wise) on completing a microbacheors while you’re still in high school and forfeit actually doing well in school. 

I can’t comment specifically from a microbachelor perspective, I rather did a micromaster in SCM and then went on to do an actual master. With this, I would definitely say that the edx course was worth it, but in the end, I am currently learning exactly the same concepts in the masters as I did in the micromasters. And I wouldnt necessarily say that I got into the master programme purely because of the edx course- rather also because of other merits. Just something to think about, particularly if you are wanting to do do a degree in CS."
152,t3_nvbc1g,edX,that site u linked is very interesting. can you make exams there ? can we make full disciplines from the eng/it university in  that site ? and the unis recognize it and credit it with needing to take the course again in the uni ?

162,t3_n5ff83,edX,"This is highly depend on the country you live in. Certificate itself has credit, but what makes this credit become trust worthy and useful is fully depend on how people view it.

For the most parts of the world such as western europe, north and south america. Central america and pacific region. Russia, east and south Asia like India, it is accepted by many people. 

I know they accepte these certificates because I google the ""successful stories"" of how people who got edx certificate get a job.

You have indian who got a job in microsoft in India for it.
You have some people who start work for google because of their certificate.
You also could see many other successful stories.

However, there is one place that you can not get recognition for your certificate. This place is China, I have not yet see any successful record conduct by edx learners. Chinese Education Bureau yet did not have any formal view toward these certificate, and that makes many people disbelief toward certificate you get.

However I believe if you went to a small company amd said you have earned a certificate from Harvard University it is highly possible that they give you a job.

So yes, it is accredites by the most parts of the world, yet expect China unless we have record for it."
163,t3_n1cr0y,edX,"if you didn't finish the required test, you should try to contact with micromaster degree provider or professor and other team member that teach you. 
If they reject to let you take the required test, then it is very unfortunately that you can't.

However I believe you can take it again.

Usually archived course can be accessed if you pay the tuition fee. I hope that apply to your course."
164,t3_n0yrkg,edX,No idea... common sense you would think it wouldn't count cause it wasn't redeemed but I've been wrong on that before. I will tell you that I have sent things off to Edx support and they are good about responding in a day. Just let them know what you're thinking... i.e. you still want to take the class but it is a different session or you are interested in something else. I feel ya I been there... good luck.

167,t3_mvkxmb,edX,"In my opinion having a certificate from popular university is a good tool for marketing yourself for a job interview with your resume.

I included 4-5 edx math and algorithms certificates when I applied to a software engineering job and I got hired. 3-4 months into the job I asked my interviewer whether these certificates gave him good signal about me, and indeed he told me that when he saw them, he assumed that my intelligence was above the mean.

So to summarize - was it worth it? It depends. Would have I gotten the job without the certs? Probably yes. Does it increase the probability to land an interview in general? In my opinion yes. Besides the career bonus that you get from the certificates to market yourself, I do not see a reason to pay for the courses, since they are free.

Best of luck."

173,t3_mnmhi6,edX,"OK, I think I figured it out. If you go through your university's dashboard to enroll in a course, they have a library of ~140 courses where the subscription will provide you with a certification for free.

For that you can apply for financial assistance if you got approved you can get upto 90% discount only on 1 course. there are many programs as well including many courses in one program. you can have financial assistance only for one course not on multiple courses or for a program.

186,t3_m9coj0,edX,"I'm currently still enrolled in this MicroMaster and at the end of course 5 and start of course 6. I've already finished the CS50 courses. The content of the courses is pretty good and they do teach you some very useful tools. But to be honest, these last parts do feel abandoned by staff. For example, I just checked the discussion forums which are used to answer questions. For the 5th course the staff hasn't responded in couple of months as far as I can tell. The last response for the capstone was about a month ago (about the bot being fixed), but that forum isn't used as much as the one for course 5. If there are answers, most of the times they're provided by students and the questions will usually take a while to be answered. If you're coming from CS50x (or MIT600xx) this difference is really night and day. CS50x has a great support group and extremely helpful staff and they do a lot of community building, which you will definitely miss in this MicroMaster.

Then the question, would I recommend this one. To be honest, I'm not sure. I did learn a lot about functional programming, UML, Java, TDD, design patterns and so on. But I could've learned that from other sources too. Perhaps ones with a better support system in place. So I guess it depends on your goals. You say you really want to do this program, so perhaps this question is better answered if you explain why. What are your intentions and goals?"

The reason I'm telling you all this detail is to caveat my opinion as slightly biased (as everyone else would be too, on this sub). I tend to look at courses as a sign that the candidate values continuing their education and has a desire to learn. Those are great qualities (especially in IT) as it means a candidate is open to learning more in the course of their employment, and is hopefully trainable. Just my two cents, but it could only be perceived as a good thing."

1) They are definetley in the 7.5 - 10 range for difficulty.   
2)   So there are no finals, each section has a quiz. You just need to get an average of 80 on all the quizzes to pass the course. The quizzes are not proctored.  
3) I did 1/4th the Masters in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance at WGU. I was able to take CYBER501 and CYBER504 together because of my familiarity with the CYBER501 material.  
4) These classes are all independent of each other. I am not doing the capstone until this summer, but I am betting the capstone builds off of all the previous four courses."

195,t3_m151ei,edX,Of the two to be fair you are at the Bachelor's level. Micromasters courses are Graduate level work and it assumes that you already have your Bachelors. If you are looking to get an actual certificate of completion you will have to meet the pre-requisites. That being said on Edx you can audit any class for free and without meeting the requirements. So if it's just for your own personal learning there is nothing stopping you. Keep in mind though that the Micro classes are usually a stepping stone into their programs. Meaning if you took a MicroBachelor's program and where verified and completed it usually some of those classes would transfer into their Bachelors program for credit if that's what you wanted.

I already feel more competent than with 'just' the college education, which isn't always that practical, for better or worse. Paying for the certificate also makes me study the contents more diligently. 

Since you are still in college, I recommend checking if your faculty offers any (free) courses or seminars in negotiation. I actually took such a course, and it was a great experience – including the final exam that happened to be a team mock negotiation."

This question is a bit course specific, because not every course will work in the same way on edX. Some are time-limited, some are more a work on your own pace. CS50 is more of the latter. You can start right now. At the start of January they usually update their course materials and transfer some or all of your grades, so you can continue the course with the new material. Usually they provide a scheme for that, so you know what you can skip and/or should look at again."
245,t3_k0w6qt,edX,Khan academy is nice but without certificates. Try coursera or udemy.
246,t3_k05axz,edX,Did you do this eventually?
247,t3_jujr0g,edX,"I've purchased both cs50w and cs50ai it doesn't show any deadline. I think you can submit any year but projects change every year , you can search about it hear [https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/faqs/](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/faqs/) . And another tip: if you haven't submitted any project just unenroll and enroll it again ."
248,t3_ju4jy0,edX,"The Harvard one is a Professional Certificate, and MIT is a MicroMasters. MIT is more rigorous with fewer classes because they’re equivalent to graduate level offerings at MIT, and are a lot more transferable if you want to go to grad school for a related program."
249,t3_ju1uo9,edX,"Seems to be the same case with this -&gt; [https://www.reddit.com/r/edX/comments/iqyl6s/edx\_increasing\_price\_to\_249\_for\_ritx\_increase\_by/](https://www.reddit.com/r/edX/comments/iqyl6s/edx_increasing_price_to_249_for_ritx_increase_by/)

250,t3_jtfmjd,edX,Micromasters are not fully funded. You can apply for financial aid for each course in the micromasters. Financial aid waives 90% of the course fee. If you get aid in all the courses you'll end up spending only 10% of the Micromasters price.
251,t3_jt855f,edX,"1) Literally state what’s been said in a summary. An incident has happened and a notification providing instructions RE minimal egress from the train. 

2) Cause has not been stated but maybe comment on possibilities such as:

On the train - carriage doors being broken in sections due to X.
Lighting not functioning, thus not being safe to exit.
Platform edge doors only working at one stage.
A protest in the station at one end and the police can only provide an exit for X amount of people or X amount of time.

3) effects. Delays, customer complaints, extra costs. Missed connections etc 

4) Resolutions: a service at the next station to those alighting there back to the previous for those that needed it or to their next place if transferring.

5) Depending on your choices for reasons. Early notification. Good comms. Maintenance regime. Planning. Etc etc"
252,t3_jriflb,edX,"Unfortunately, as EdX doesn't allow multiple accounts, you'll have to wait it out. Perhaps hold off from class discussions on the first few days until your name is changed, so that nobody else can see your legal name.

I haven't participated much in discussions since joining my courses, so I can't say much from personal experience."
253,t3_jr1tjv,edX,"I took the Micromasters program and am now in the process of completing the MS in IT Management. This will not help you implement software solutions in depth. The three courses for the Micromasters are Enterprise Data Management, Digital Technology and Innovation, and Digital Ecosystem Infrastructure. 

I took the program because I'm in IT Management in a particular area (Workstream Collaboration) and wanted to understand other foundational technologies at an executive level. My background was in Social Sciences, is I did not have the background others have from MIS or Comp Sci. You will get your feet wet in a lot of different areas, but it's more of a 15,000 ft. view where you learn the basics in order to understand trends and how to manage an IT organization.

I'd highly recommend it for those wanting to improve their understanding of IT from a managerial perspective. I've learned a lot and feel very knowledgeable about the important things (data, analytics, ERP, Cyber, etc.)"
254,t3_jpm65s,edX,"My weekly CS50 Structure:  
-Monday - watch lecture  
-Rest of the week - work on the assignments  

I spend about 5-10 hours per week, but I am behind the scheduled pace. Not by much, but a bit. Biggest thing is occasionally getting stuck on a problem that might take a few nights to solve. I usually set a time limit before looking up a tutorial so I don't get frustrated and quit. Example, if I start a problem Tuesday and I've struggled with it until Thursday, on Friday I will watch a tutorial. It's very gratifying solving problems after being stuck, but I have no shame in looking for help if I feel I've put in my best effort.

David Malan is an unreal instructor and touches on lots of concepts I didn't understand despite having taken some other CS courses online. Highly recommend it.

EDIT: I started around September 1st and I am just about to finish Week 9 (Flask)."
255,t3_jn0b2d,edX,No need for the green check. Just get the above pass grade percentage.
256,t3_jmvjzr,edX,"It really depends on the course, some (like cs50) allow you to complete the whole course for free (without getting the edX certificate), while other limit your access or set an expiration date for the audit track."
257,t3_jmgzz0,edX,Good luck and happy learning. Speaking from experience doing other courses by MITx your journey definitely won't be easy but it will be very very rewarding. Don't get discouraged if you don't perform well on all the psets and keep going from the next day. Perseverance is your best friend. Prioritise learning over the progress bar and you are sure to greatly appreciate the course and gain deep insight about the material.
258,t3_jktc3e,edX,Feels like a wide range of quality. I’ve started and skimmed a bunch of mediocre classes. But was hooked 150% when I took CS50x.
259,t3_jjyy38,edX,"You do get the knowledge...?
But yeah, these days I haven't seen any course that gives certificates for free (Doesn't surprise me though, it is their business model )"
260,t3_jj7fyy,edX,"Depends if you’re going to write a personal statement or actually be able to showcase the effort you’re putting in. If you applying to the UK then you’ll be able to.

In that case, it could be worth doing one or two courses to show that you’re willing to study the subject outside of the classroom and in your own time. I finished my A-levels last year and applied to unis in Australia. I got offered a scholarship covering 25% of fees, I think completing a few courses and showcasing that helped because my grades were pretty average.

I would recommend one offered by Imperial. It’s relevant and you also learn other methods to solve A level style problems. Just don’t make it a priority, if you feel the course is making you slack on your A-levels then stop. Last thing you want is playing catch up, especially during covid when there’s added stress.

Best of luck to you"
261,t3_jdeuwq,edX,If your course is “self paced” then you can change the due dates. But if it is not you need to email edX help  center.
262,t3_jcsdqg,edX,You can apply for financial aid
263,t3_jc0rxs,edX,No you won't. If you just bought the course and it got archived then try contacting their customer support and telling them that you were not aware that once it gets archived you can't get certification. They will most probably enroll you in the next iteration free of charge.
264,t3_jaodlo,edX,Are you verified on edx? Did you send in your id pic and face pic to them to get verified ? If not I would email the edX help center and they will reach out to you in two days or so...
265,t3_janqz4,edX,Get the cause from edx now is available

267,t3_j96iai,edX,"You most likely are just having internet issues. You could reboot your computer and see if that helps or possibly connect to another internet source. 

You could maybe have some firewall issues but if you've been doing the course so far without issues then that's probably not the case.

Hopefully you were able to get on and take your test! If not good luck!"
268,t3_j743ro,edX,u shld prolly just email the college. theyll figure it out
269,t3_j69hpv,edX,"If it’s not self-led, you won’t be able to view it until the course start date. No need to worry!"
270,t3_j42bbg,edX,It sounds like someone is trying to hack your account.  I think it would be a good idea to contact edX support right away!
271,t3_j3p4d1,edX,I know a couple of people who have done that with the Supply chain management micromasters. I'd suggest doing a LinkedIn search. There are many examples (depending on which micromasters of course)
272,t3_j360bx,edX,"Try applying for financial aid over at edx.

If you can make a case for it, there's a good chance you'll get it."
273,t3_j1ek9z,edX,"So it depends, on what you want I don't think either will help too much for actually getting a job but if you have enough experience in python definitely go with HarvardX.

I will saw IBM is definitely faster and would be even more so with your python background, so you. 

Both have a capstone project, I think IBM is 8 or 9 courses and HarvardX is 11 courses. I'd say IBM focuses too much on Watson and their programs tho from what I've done so far but I'm not at the python part yet. HarvardX jumps straight into R so that's a plus."
274,t3_j1n0q2,edX,"I'm in the process of taking them now. They seem easier than the exams and homeworks, thank God."
275,t3_j1ojr2,edX,this is the exact same class as 6.86 Applied ML
276,t3_j02v5y,edX,Definitely the Harvard courses. CS50 is amazing and exactly the same as what is taught at Harvard campus.
277,t3_iy7z6t,edX,"Now, Its an archived version only. even if you pay, you won't get the certificate."
278,t3_ivvo25,edX,"The course that I paid for, had assignments that would be blind peer reviewed, and I would get suggestions as well. You'll hear people saying that it's not really that big a deal on your CV, but sometimes it's the only difference, which shows how self motivated you are. Hope this helps :)"
279,t3_ivuq8s,edX,You'll have to wait until a new session is started for the course. Depends for each course. Some start maybe a few weeks after the audit expiry deadline. Others are offered every year.
280,t3_iu1rst,edX,no but try looking into financial aid.
281,t3_itozqu,edX,Way to go kiddo 👏🏼👏🏼
282,t3_it3p6a,edX,"I had this issue and I enrolled unfortunately with one of the micro masters with Arizona States University which started August 20ish, and after two day’s of reading I got busy with work and suddenly in September 8th I discovered I fail because there’s a deadline for my assignments and I have not apply any of the assignments still,
The instructor asking us to do the assignments with a partner and I posted in the course discussion to find a partner but no response, and I’m still waiting and looking at this money I waste on this useless course,
I tried and sent emails to EDX they said email university... and when I emailed university they said send the email to the instructor, I even spoke to the professor assistant through LinkedIn and still no response,
Then I figured you can log in to edx through browser and when you go to the course you can select session or choose “select session later”, and that’s how I postponed the rest of the course until I find out a way to solve the assignments issue....
So yeah upon your question there is different sessions and you will be able to check before you pay, just use the browser."
283,t3_is89im,edX,Contact support.

286,t3_iq5x94,edX,"Try asking for an official letter on the MIT [Micromasters page](https://micromasters.mit.edu/) (you can find the 'Help' button at the bottom right part of the page). They're not really quick to reply, but I was able to ask for a corporate invoice there."
287,t3_ipw2fr,edX,"Credit for any of the micro masters programs is contingent on admission to the program. 

At the end of the day you're talking about applying to a PhD program at MIT. Your undergraduate and graduate records are going to carry a lot more weight than a MOOC."
288,t3_iof07c,edX,"You can submit a ticket through the support page, you should be able to see the ""submit a request"" at the bottom of the support page (direct link is [here](https://courses.edx.org/support/contact_us)).  
Also the requests dashboard is accessible (link [here](https://support.edx.org/hc/en-us/requests/)), where you can access and monitor all of your requests."
289,t3_imi711,edX,"1. You only have to pay if you want a verified certificate. You can enroll for free and access the videos immediately. 
2. Correct, the 4-6 hours include estimated time for non-video studying and assignments."
290,t3_ikm437,edX,Just a guess: do you have your adblock on? Sometimes it makes random elements on webpages disappear.
291,t3_ij1fg7,edX,"In all honesty you will not need the cs50 certificate unless your goal is to show support for the program. 

If your goal is to get a job, having the verified certificate makes no difference in the real world."
292,t3_iiohfy,edX,The military is a damn fickle beast.  You're best off talking to a recruiter and GET IT IN WRITING.  Years ago they wouldn't accept a homeschool diploma under any conditions.  Now they generally welcome them.  Any information you can find would generally be based off of old data.
293,t3_ihsslq,edX,No.
294,t3_igk6v2,edX,"According to edX support when you applied for the financial aid if you did not see your course in the dropdown menu then it may not be eligible for Financial Assistance.  
And if you did find it in the dropdown menu and applied for the aid and got denied then there's no other way to know for sure if a course is eligible for aid or not.  


Anyhoo, you could look at Coursera for your desired courses if you are looking for certificates. They have some free offers because of the COVID-19 situation.  
Good luck."
295,t3_igenv1,edX,"In my opinion, if the course and staff support is the same, then none. If someone asks where I got my certificate from, I say HarvardX. If they ask me what portal or provider I used (which never happens), I would say edX. 

If you are asking about course differences or difficulty, I wouldn’t be able to tell you. Maybe write the professor who is offering the course and ask? They may be creating the curriculum and materials for both."
296,t3_idcc6d,edX,Use credit card...i paid via ICICI credit card last month.
297,t3_ib2s6l,edX,So the course is not at your own pace? If not it sounds like you would be pretty far behind and at risk of failing the course. That might discourage you a bit. Confirm it’s not at your own pace?
298,t3_iarg9z,edX,"To be honest, consider that you have to convince a person. Tell them what problems you face, what you did to sort them out and why this course is so necessary? BTW, are you taking CS50?"
299,t3_iasg32,edX,"I haven't heard great things about the NYU Microbachelors. I'm currently in the last class of the HarvardX Data Science program, which is around $500 total and pretty informative imo. As a current undergrad student I'd say either program would look good on a college app. Feel free to PM if you have any questions!"
300,t3_ib1auj,edX,"They might be a few reasons that can stop your certificate of showing up.

1- You don't have verified your identity on edX

2- You have a missing activity or lesson

3 - Progress bar don't show 100% because you have a pending grade on any activity.

&amp;#x200B;

If this is not your case, you'll be able to see the certificate under the CS50 course, [like this](https://i.imgur.com/BNg8T5V.png). If the course it's related to a professional certificate program, then you should click the related program link, that will take you to the program's dashboard and you'll see the certificate of the program."
301,t3_ia194p,edX,You should have done it earlier...I think it is due to the difference in timeline not sure though
302,t3_i8nr2s,edX,"it says 1/1 point graded so it was submitted successfully. 

""Save"" is for when you don't want to submit the answer for grading but want it to be there if you reload the page.  If you just want to submit the answer click ""submit.""  You don't need to click ""save."""
303,t3_i5curl,edX,What's the issue?
304,t3_i3ue7i,edX,"I am having the same issue, only I am from the US."
305,t3_i3kjgh,edX,Professional development is always a plus. Shows an employer that you are constantly trying to hone your current skills or learn new ones to help your career along.
306,t3_i2ylzr,edX,"I think I've seen people discussing the supply chain micromasters so you might be able to find their conversations.

On edx... by itself having this isn't going to advance your career. What will do that is you learning new things that can relate to your job or future position. If you feel that these courses will give you some knowledge that you can apply then maybe it will help you. But just like all education, whether official or not, or on personal time or school time or work time, it's all about what you make of it. Taking these courses so you can show the certificate and then voila now you are qualified isn't really a thing in my opinion.  Having said all this, I've taken 15-20 classes and chose to do the certificate on all but 1 or 2 because it helps me to finish if I've got skin in the game and I also like having access to the questions to assess myself on whether I'm comprehending it or not. My company paid for some and I chose to pay for the others. 

On the timing, I find that of the many I've taken, I'm usually on the short side of the timing window. So if it says 8 weeks at 2-6 hours per week, I'd guess that I should finish in between 16-48 hours total and if I timed myself on this fictional scenario I'd probably finish in 20 hours. So take the timing with a grain of salt. If it's a totally new subject maybe it takes a bit longer and if it's fine tuning something you already work with then maybe you blast through it much faster.

Overall, I've learned a lot (mostly in programming, AI and data science topics) and would recommend you give it a try. You can always take 1 course and if you don't like it, don't take the rest."
307,t3_i2we0y,edX,"No sorry, but maybe it's worth asking edX or the Berkley team?"
308,t3_i2xp2s,edX,"Finance and accounting are different. Which side you do you want to know? Finance is about future investments; accounting is about presentation on historical transactions. There are also different fields of accounting. I think for your desire to do side business, managerial accounting is more suitable. I recommend Mark Meldrum's managerial accounting on YouTube. I didn't do that series particularly but he was very throughout and easy to understand for someone not familiar with the topic presented, on the CFA series that I did."

311,t3_hzxkp2,edX,"The ideal preparation is

1. MIT's Calculus course (edx or ocw)
2. MIT Linear Algebra- Strang (ocw)
3. MIT Probability (edx or ocw)

The best way to know if you are ready is to take their Self- Assessment Test. Since Micromasters is of the same rigor as the on-campus program, this should be useful. Link below

312,t3_hzrkbm,edX,While I haven't seen any edx courses there is a history of science course by crash course on YouTube.
313,t3_hz3uhx,edX,"1. For prereqs, they're mostly strong suggestions... you will probably struggle a bit without the foundations of calculus, but they don't actively check for whether or not you've completed it at the college level. On that note:
2. If you haven't taken calculus since high school, I would recommend at least auditing a course for a refresher. MIT also has their openware courses.
3. You can register for just one course at a time... The only real downside to this is that if you verify all of the courses in the MicroMasters together, you do get a discount
4. Each class will have a verification deadline to pay for the certificates. This is normally (but NOT always) a few weeks into the course. More information can be found on each course page.
5. On the MicroMasters page, there is a full list of colleges that have established acceptance protocols for the MicroMasters and how each college accredits it towards their respective Masters."
314,t3_hytv2m,edX,i also want to know the answer to question 3!
315,t3_hz3e6x,edX,"I did! Wasn't at all what I expected, but really enjoyed it. Me and 2 friends signed up and I was the only one to see it through. It's more thought provoking than law based."
316,t3_hyr98l,edX,"Georgia Tech and ASU have a good chance of accepting stuff from their own online programs. At least Georgia Tech should, seeing that they keep spamming advertising for their accredited online comp sci and data science programs.

You'd have to check, but I'm doubtful the credits carry you very far when it comes to choice of colleges to transfer to. They like their cartel over the magic little piece of sheepskin."

What is a MicroMasters Program?
MicroMasters programs are a series of graduate level courses from top universities designed to advance your career. MicroMasters program certificates showcase deep learning and in-demand skills to employers and can help you get started on a path toward completing an advanced degree.

How to Earn a MicroMasters Program Certificate
To earn the program certificate, learners must complete and successfully earn a verified certificate in all four MicroMasters program courses, as well as the capstone project.

From Program Certificate to a Master’s Degree
MicroMasters programs are designed to offer learners a pathway to an advanced degree and can count as credit toward completing a Master’s degree program. Learners who successfully earn this MicroMasters program certificate may apply for admission to a Master’s program, and if accepted, the MicroMasters program certificate will count towards the degree.

Learners who successfully earn the MicroMasters program certificate may apply to the Master of Science program Sustainable Energy Technology (SET) or the Master of Science program Electrical Engineering (track: Electrical Power Engineering) at TU Delft. You will need to go through the regular admission procedures for MSc students and meet the entry requirements for those MSc programs. If you are admitted and you would like to be exempted from courses in the aforementioned MSc programs, you are required to send a formal waiver request. Campus courses that can be waived (up to 16-18 credits) are courses that are equivalent to the solar energy courses of the MSc program in question:

MSc Sustainable Energy Technology
MSc Electrical Engineering (Electrical Power Engineering track)
View Frequently Asked Questions.

Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) offers a pathway to credit for MicroMasters program certificate holders toward RIT's Master of Science in Professional Studies. This is an interdisciplinary degree program that allows students to strategically combine multiple, complementary in-demand fields of study. Read more about the program and how to apply with your MicroMasters program certificate."
323,t3_hsxwd7,edX,"You should be able to. The Help page states EdX is open to all.

The only thing they do mention about age is that if you're under 13 your profile will be limited.

So go ahead and enjoy!"
324,t3_hsr3ya,edX,"Looks like someone trying to access your account.  

Been a couple of these recently.  Although I don’t know why anyone would want to access someone else’s edX account?  Seems weird"
325,t3_hsryup,edX,You need to pay for the course for quizzes I believe
326,t3_hs60bj,edX,"Which course is it?
You might want to look at the timing of the course. If it is self paced, this is definitely an issue, but if it’s guided by the teacher, then typically content is release on schedule (most of my courses have been weekly releases). You might also want to check and see if there’s a “schedule” tab for the course, which can tell you more 😊"
327,t3_hqx6qz,edX,The article didn’t say you can audit again. It says that you can pay once your access expires
328,t3_hoz2bj,edX,"It varies course to course. If it’s instructor led, it should have a posted enrollment deadline, if it’s self-paced, you’ll see more info on it once you’re working through the course."
329,t3_hkh9ud,edX,You can access the support textbook [textbook](https://leanpub.com/dataanalysisforthelifesciences)
330,t3_hjiv64,edX,"I completed the Machine Learning course from this program what I can say so far, it's interesting but it doesn't include any deep dive so basically you can't understand what's happening behind those algorithms if you're willing to, just apply them and try to interpret the result.

The forum is interacting, a lot of discussions happening but most of them are code issues because students use a different version of R(which was a pain in the ass) and end up with different results so different responses, and finally, the course was not peer-graded, you have to answer questions along the way."
331,t3_hj71v5,edX,"Support normally takes 3-5 days to get back to me. You can also try posting a staff question in the discussion forum of your class. Even if the staff themselves can’t help you, they can probably elevate it to support faster."
332,t3_hinx0k,edX,A bachelors is perfectly fine for starting off. It's the beginning fundamentals of any field. Just make sure to research as you go so you truly understand the material.
333,t3_hh9e7d,edX,"in my experience, each course is different, but they usually tell you how many attempts you will have. I’ve seen it mentioned in the course syllabus, on a text page just before the quiz, and on the quiz when you are selecting/inputting answers it will show something like 0/1 attempt or 0/2 attempts.  Hope that helps!"
334,t3_hh9utz,edX,"If the course is being shown as self paced and EdX is showing ""Upgrade to Get unlimited access with a verified certificate"",then the certificate can be completed by receiving a passing grade in all subjects. I recently did two courses that was going to completely end.I upgraded to verified mode and I got a additional year i.e until next year to finish the course on my own pace. In most courses that has ended their initial course dates but still showing verified option,when you select audit track won't show you exercises on the course."
335,t3_hg413s,edX,I want to take this course because it is credit eligible. But would the cost of making the course (or certificate) credit eligible $600? Or is the $49 enough?
336,t3_hg6e7b,edX,You’ll get both! You get a course completion certificate for each course you complete (regardless if you buy them together or separate) and then the program certificate once you’ve earned all the course certificates

364,t3_guzbe1,edX,"My feeling is it would differ course by course. However, ***all*** the courses I have taken have open book exams, so I guess open book is the most common model. (That's just one person's experience.) Most courses should tell you very clearly whether the quizzes &amp; exams are open book. For the courses I took, **I freely refer to my course notes, lecture videos, and my own answers to prior quizzes &amp; homeworks.** 

Open book means open book. If lecture 2 says ""here is the formula for net present value"" then you are allowed to look at that formula up anywhere you want (not only in the notes).

I doubt that using a fill-in-the-blanks financial calculator would be cheating for ***most*** courses, ***if*** it is open book. You probably get more learning from working a formula yourself one time on your own, though, or by playing around with calculator inputs and seeing how the output changes (e.g. in a compound interest situation, would you rather double the interest rate, double the period of investment, or double the initial investment?).

* Do not have another person do the work for you.

The course forums exist for you to get hints &amp; that is completely OK unless the TAs put a stop to it.

365,t3_guttha,edX,"No, you won’t lose it.  If you received an average grade that meets the pass threshold without completing the final assignments, you still pass and get the certificate early. 

This happened to me for two courses.  But as much as much as I liked he certificate, I was in it to learn something, so I continued and finished regardless.  I mean after all that time and the $$ investment, it would be silly to not finish it.

For the unenrolled class, the classes are offered as individual courses.  They’re sequential for a certificate, but still available as stand-alones.  Once they’re archived they’re gone.  A person needs to stay in them to be grandfathered.  It’s unfortunate, but it’s gone now, and it’s not guaranteed it will be re-offered.  You could always email edX to ask if it can be reoffered, and perhaps give a sob story (with great repentance) asking if they could take pity on you and undo the unenrolement to save you and allow you to continue.

If you check the edX page for the specific MM you're interested in it'll tell you which universities have agreements in place to accept it for credit.

Does it transfer to other universities?  It's at the discretion of the specific university.  Some will, but honestly and maybe controversially I think that most won't.  People seem to be skeptical of online programs and I bet many unis would rather charge full price and milk people for money.

At the very least though, it will surely help with admissions, and the skills and knowledge that you learn will probably help in future studies and employment.

I also found that the discussions in that program made me aware of the latest tools and learning apps that I hadn’t seen before. 

Overall, worth the price of admission. You’ll get out what you put into it. You may even decide to pursue the rest of the UMUC degree online. Up to you. Good luck!

Edit:  I'm doing courses and a program from Wharton UPenn, and am doing a course from Harvard which nicely compliments the courses from Wharton (ties it all together well), but my Harvard class is not officially linked to my Wharton ones.  

However, I noticed the end deadlines for final course completion was suddenly pushed back by several months (earlier this week the deadlines for all of the courses was late May to early June.  But woke up one morning and now it's December 2020?  After I've been busting my butt for 6 weeks for 8-10 hours / day to meet the end-of-May deadline).  

I don't get it.   And the assignment dates (each module assignment date) has now disappeared suddenly.

I'm wondering, because courses are cyclical, and because so many start in January and are up for 5-6 months, if the near-end period makes it so we just happened to be in the stream as the course cycles reset, pushing things back. 

Regardless, considering how finicky the online platform can sometimes be, I'm not leaving anything to chance, and am still going to continue working my butt off to complete all assignments and final projects by the original dates posted before they expire (the pre-push back dates). 

The last thing I want if to slow down now, work past those original dates (yet conform to the new dates) and have the system tell me I failed because I didn't meet the deadlines owing to having enrolled under the framework of an earlier course cycle.  I wouldn't leave anything to chance. 

Thoughts anyone?"
394,t3_gg9nxg,edX,yes
395,t3_gfypa2,edX,"To be clear a MicroMasters Certificate is not a Masters Degree.  Well, not a full one at least. The one you're considering is 1/3 of the Masters.  

Can I ask, where are you from?  You used the word CV instead of Resume.  Are you British?

The reason I ask is because here in the UK we have what is called a Postgraduate Certificate.  This Micromasters is essentially the same thing IMO.  A university certificate made up of postgraduate courses equaling 1/3 of the masters.

That makes it simple for me to explain my MicroMasters to any employer or contact who asks, because a PGCert is quite well known here (every single teacher requires one for example).

Is having a MicroMasters valuable?  Yeah, definitely!  Becoming more qualified generally improves one's opportunities and potential earnings.

Completing such study also shows an interest in the subject area, determination, ambition, and gives some evidence of skills such as planning and good time management etc.

Of course you'll surely gain some knowledge and skills in Cloud Computing too.  Also the opportunity to put it towards the full masters if you ever choose.

People sometimes say ""MOOCs are useless!"", well I disagree for the above reasons but also in the real world I've only ever had positive responses towards my extra studies, and my MicroMasters helped me get a great job with a top company.

The Micromasters is also very, very affordable relatively speaking.  Plus there is financial aid if you need it.

So in conclusion, I can't talk for the specifics of that program, but I think MicroMasters in general are great.

You should look into alternatives though and weigh them all up.  There are Google Cloud, AWS, Azure certs etc.  Perhaps one is better than the other.  Or perhaps the Micromasters would compliment one of those very well.  I dunno.

Good luck"

Finally, you can ask them to make give you a discount. Hope this helps you."
403,t3_gdsl2k,edX,"Which one are you considering?

It may depend on the specific MicroMasters, but when I did mine... each class ran from a set date to a set date for the duration of the class.  Start of January to end of February for 8 weeks for example.  

The pass mark had to be reached by the end of those 8 weeks or else it'd count as a fail and I'd have had to pay to resit the next time the course ran.  

For example, with the exception of the capstone exam course I could have done the week 3 test in week 3 when it opened, or I could have left it to the last minute, but the class has a distinct end date.

You don't have to do every class at the same time.  You can do it slower if you'd like, one by one for example.  That may be necessary if you are busy and have other commitments.

I hope that makes sense.  Also I think a few MicroMasters may be being discontinued at the end of 2020 or early 2021 so you may want to double check with edX just to make sure you have time to complete it."

I will honestly say, no one could possibly pay me enough to do it again, but now that I am near the end it feels incredibly rewarding, and very applicable to my role as a junior data scientist at my company that is already doing machine learning. My advice for anyone considering starting:

1. Take one class at a time if you work full time or don't have 30 hours a week to dedicate to the classes. They are rigorous, and it is easy to fall behind.
2. Suggested order: Probability, Statistics, Data Analysis in Social Science, ML in Python - this is not the order I did it in but it would have been a much better choice
3. To earn the certificate in the specific classes, you only need 60% - for me, just the certificate matters and not the actual grade - I make sure I attain a 60% before the final exam and skip the final. The course content is available for up to a year after the class has finished and it is possible use the final exam answers to study later for the capstone :)

Personally, I audit most courses, but I recently paid for a programming course, because I thought it would be useful for a job application.

If you are looking for courses that count towards your degree, you will have to take that up with your university/department. I'd say picking some semi-random courses and hoping for the best is not going to be worth it.

If you're looking to learn more about the topic of your degree, and perhaps put yourself at an advantage for when you do resume your education.. then maybe try looking up a syllabus and see if you can find similar courses on EdX. That might very well be worth it.

If you just want to learn something new about a topic you're interested in, and need a structured way to go about it. Enroll, and have fun, definitely worth it."
440,t3_fnlaem,edX,"Yes  you are entering in the middle and have to cram. Both courses have weekly assignments  


For data science: you can start now but you have already missed many deadlines. I'm in the course right now. You need to pass the course and then enroll in the final assessment to get a certificate. It's weird but that's how it's set up. The course ends next month. You'll be learning from the 2019 Nobel prize winning professor of economics, there's a lot of R and web scraping as well as probability. 

For the probability course, I took this last year, and if you plan to enroll for credit, it many no longer be mathematically possible to pass. There's very likely a midterm coming up very soon that you'd have to do a ton of work to catch up. If you register in audit mode you won't have to pay anything and can see the midterm schedule and grading policy that should give you a good idea of whether you can still pass. They drop a few of the graded exercises so the zeros you'll have on some of the earlier assignments won't hurt you. 

You can certainly enroll in both courses in audit mode without pursuing the certified track then sign up again next time they are offered. This will give a head start."
441,t3_fnl8rn,edX,You can represent your knowledge gained from there.
442,t3_fmbgzf,edX,"&gt;	do these courses translate to paper/resumes? 

There is nothing preventing you from adding coursework to your resume. I have a section of my resume under “education” labeled “other coursework” Which contains any relevant on my courses. I imagine that it would be weighed or considered similarly to a single non-credit course; that is to say, it’s very unlikely that a single online course is going to make a difference in your job hunt. It does tend to demonstrate that you are an autodidact, and all employers want someone who can grow and learn.
&gt;	Further to this, are these courses good? 

Some yes, some less so. There’s a lot of variance in quality, so asking this question is roughly similar to asking “how good is a chemistry course” without specifying which course it is, which university of that, which professor is teaching it, etc. however, the opportunity cost of trying of course is pretty low. It’s free, and within 20 or 30 minutes you should start to get a feel as to the quality of the course. My recommendation is that you go for it: find a course with good reviews and try it, and if you don’t like it, try another, and if you don’t like it, try another."
443,t3_fm61j8,edX,What I've learn from asking that question on other forums is most jobs look at your projects. I think using EDX to learn would be good if you have any experience and then to develop a portfolio with projects once you get a better idea of what you are doing.
444,t3_flkx55,edX,It varies depending on the MicroMasters course. Some of the MM programs are not actually accepted by the teaching institution involved. Check the MM page for more information.

That said, if you did join the course and upgrade today, you should still be able to pass the course - we try not to allow learners to purchase a certificate if they can't still get a passing grade.

458,t3_evwwui,edX,"My understanding is that the enrollment deadlines and course completion deadlines are set regardless of if or when you pay.

The reality of edx is that many classes have moderators or teachers who only spend time on that class for a certain window of time. 

Whatever the course deadline is, it's the same timeframe if you purchase it before the class starts or the day before the deadline."
459,t3_er8x3z,edX,"I have been taking notes and attempting to do the readings (have not gotten to all, but probably 75% at least)... I've been saving the readings as PDFs when possible.  Would be nice to be able to go back to the full course content indefinitely but I believe that's not possible, as they get archived after courses formally end.  To make my notes more useful, I've been structuring them as follows and attempting to be diligent on the last few parts:

* I take notes on all the course content as I go through it (I use Microsoft OneNote but you could use a Google Doc or whatever...)
* I maintain my own glossary of new terminology I learn about 
* I keep track of things I want to come back to, like links that were introduced to other pieces of material not actually required by the course... things that sounded interesting to me but don't really have time to do right now
* Try to keep a list of things that are directly applicable to my personal work/goals (i.e. why I took the source in the first place)
* At the end, I plan to write myself a summary of the course, which will be a single page or two explaining what I learned, the key things I took away  from it personally, and resources to refer back to down the road.  This is probably the most important thing to not skip, in my opinion.

Of course, the specifics of these things is going to vary based on the type of course you are taking, but I imagine the general concepts are pretty universally applicable."
460,t3_eqz3tf,edX,"Have you looked into Walmart's education programs? You can get a bachelor's degree for a $1 a day (so about $360 a year, along with reimbursement for anything you spend textbooks). It's only for certain subjects, but I know they offer a few in stuff like IT and cybersecurity, along with others I may have forgotten.

464,t3_elzj7p,edX,"I can only give you information about the statistics and data science micromaster:

You are given automated tests and no individual feedback but there are quite active forum discussions and (sometimes) quite detailed solutions for the problems.

But you have to realize that you are pretty much on your own while doing homework problems and unit exercises because it is forbidden to discuss any of the ""active"" problems in the forums. Once they are graded you are free to discuss the problems in the forums but I hardly ever did that because I did not really have time to get back to solved problems because I had a hard time to keep up with the coursework.

It took me days to finish some of my homework assignment and some of the unit exercises because they are HARD. The exams for the courses are 2 days take home exams and open book so can use any ressource to tackle those exam questions (you will need this because they are hard too).

The final capstone exams are closed book 2 hour tests. So you have to be proficient (and fast!) in solving quite tricky math problems. And I have to add that only correct answers count any points. If you made some error along the way you loose all the points for a question

And unless you are already pretty good in linear algebra, calculus, probability theory, programing and statistics you will have to invest considerably more than 14h per week per course.

The coursework is also very theoretical."

In this situation it isn’t beneficial to withhold skills from your CV. Managers that do the hiring through these agencies know what they want and can happily ignore the rest.

&amp;#x200B;

Rattling off a list of MOOC that you've done (like if you're a native Spanish/English speaker and you took an intro to Spanish) where you're basically just ""learning"" things you already knew makes it look like you have too much time on your hands and kinda a kiss ass looking for endless validation.  Again, this would not apply, say, if you were a native speaker but took a written grammar class and can show that you now have greater competency in the language."

568,t3_agtlka,edX,"It’s up for debate whether or not employers value you them or not. Personally, I have presented them in interviews and it hasn’t really persuaded hiring managers in leaning one way or another. However, what I’ve learned from the content has given me the confidence and skill that I’ve needed to demonstrate knowledge, capability, and confidence in solving their problem during the interview. Simply stating you have a cert doesn’t cut it, as I’m sure you’re aware. 

I think when it comes to progressing in your career or transferring departments at the company you’re employed at, they could be more valuable as you may have already built trust and demonstrated performance in the job role you’re currently in and the certificates would be a way of showing you’re dedicated to that new role. "

Anyone else had this issue fixed?? "
575,t3_a71824,edX,"I m mostly part of the silent majority, but if I take time to write here, it's because I think this decision is more than marginally WRONG.

I took cs50, MIT6.01, AI, embedded system... and so on. It was a first step to take a computer degree.

Today, I m devOps passing the OSCP. I learned so much thanks to this platform. embeeded, computer, biology, chinese.. you name it, I have probably studied it on your platform.

If I had to pay for these courses, I would simply have had no way to make it happens. And the truth is, even when I wasn t motivated to work and learn, the gradded approach kept me going through the good and bad.

Thanks to this, I m a better man today than I would have ever been with traditionnal courses/learning methods, it gave me back the curiosity I lost on my way to life. 

You especially talked about this in your ted talk, how to communicate passion and curiosity, to your own daughter. You were one of my favorite ted talks with Tim Urban.

It was understandable in 2015 to change the model to only offer verification certificate to the paying students and not giving it anymore without proper verification.

But today, you are ready to close the doors on what made this plaform stands out, giving education and knowledge to the left-outs, to the peoples whose could not attend,  nor have the money or opportunities to get better acces to knowledge and education. IMO grading is an imperative part of the process of learning and this new formula is just an empty shell, binding people to pay. 

But clearly the demographic targets: whose can pay more than 500$ US on a course (not a degree), don t really need edx, they can follow and pay any standard cursus. The ones whose will be left out, are the ones who already have very few choices in terms of educations, with poor acces to quality material and infrastructure, or simply stuck in minimum wage work to sustain the day to day. 

I believe, if that change pass, this would be a failure for our model of society, this would indeed mean we could not find a way to sustain free quality education platform, while we have no problem finding funds for wars, social media and of course, personnal greed...

The worst part, in my opinion, is that the marginal cost to grade non paying students is close to 0 compared to the cost of the platform. (more electricity? more calculating power?)

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if this choice is motivated by rentability or sustainability, but I do hope you find an alternative, else this would be a sad day

576,t3_a6bkrj,edX,"I'm wondering you even got an answer. My experience with edX is extremely bad. I used edX for years without any problems; then I couldn't upgrade to verified due to a bug in the web application (server side error 500) and contacted their support. It was the worst experience I ever had. They don't read your mail. Whatever you write, the first answer will be ""clear your cookies"" bullshit :/. I even installed Google Chrome and had the same error, and then they asked me to change my internet service (whatever that means :)).

580,t3_9mwp0d,edX,"""500"" denotes a server-side error. And since you're getting the same problem with different devices, the issue is on edX's side. Or, perhaps the particular course you're trying to pay for has the issues."

It’s a toss up on the certification. It looks good on your resume if you need to fill space on your resume. You can always just say you took the class and how you applied the knowledge you learned to your job. If you already have experience in the field or a bachelors degree, then it might not help much. Employers could also look at it and think you’re a self starter. The short answer is that it depends."
593,t3_98kgqj,edX,"They will probably not disclose this. But I guess it's based on machine learning, which basically means there is not a fixed ""algorithm"" you could look at.

Is it a full stack developer certificate with beginner, intermediate, and advanced curses?

There are medium, and small employers that will think it's BS.  


It's a lot like an extra curricular certificate, some employers will value it highly, some will disregard it as just a nice little paper from a hobby you've got. Remember always make sell it if you want it to mean something."
607,t3_8nugox,edX,"I would totally recommend starting MITs upcoming Data Science MicroMasters. The courses aren't out yet but you can start the ""Data Analysis for Social Scientists"" course or you could start doing some probability and calculus in case you don't have a Maths background.

If you find it hard to fit MIT courses around your schedule, check out the other Data Science MicroMasters like the one from UCSanDiegoX. The MicroMasters are really great courses. Pick courses that have a substantial time investment, the rest aren't worth the effort.
Another great way to see how useful a course would be is to check how much the University offers for that course. Microsoft courses won't get you a job at Microsoft and aren't really recognised by Universities but the MicroMasters are respected by the unis that offer them."

I needed a refresher course with Khanacademy and I'd say complete all of algebra and calculus. Khanacademy's statistics classes are not exactly complete and for me I used Smartly's MBA (free) as a substitute as well as the Six Sigma Yellow Belt course provided by TUM (also on edX).

641,t3_783whq,edX,Depending on your High School most likely you will not (especially if you don't pay for a certificate).  But I do recommend you take the AP exam in early May just for the college credit (only in some colleges).  This way you will have AP Comp Sci on your transcript.
642,t3_757lf4,edX,"I haven't taken 6.001, but when i began programming I was encouraged to write the program a little without any loops.

vals[0] = stuff;

vals[1] = stuff;

vals[2] = stuff;

vals[3] = stuff;

....

At some point you will feel a bit silly writing out every single statement and have to rewrite it as a loop.

for(int i =0; i&lt;end; i++){

   vals[i] = stuff;

}

Don't put your self down if you have find you should have written something as a loop, it's just apart of the possess of programming.

Soon you will get the sense you need a loop, or a while loop, or nested loops BEFORE you write them. It just takes practice and experience.

If we set the money aspect aside...  The question really is, why not?  Sure, if there are other things that you feel you could be doing that would look better on a college application, you may want to try to figure out which is more important, but at the end of the day, once you finish the course (verified cert. or not), you'll have learned something that will help you in your college career.  I'd say that's better than not having it at all.

If money is an issue for the cert., FWIW you can still list the course itself and any knowledge you gained from it on an application/resume/CV, you just wouldn't say it's verified.

It's my opinion that putting this course on your application would at least show that you have a committment to learn outside of your immediate, obligatory classes.

By your username I'm going to assume that you are Brazilian (even though you could be Portuguese or other).


Here in São Paulo I've had some luck with the Supply Chain certificates from MIT (not Micromaster yet). It's certainly a big differential between me and other candidates, aside from my university.


When I go to group dynamics and exercises, HR or the company handling the hiring process doesn't care about my certifications, asking one or two questions about it, but when present, the managers hiring always seem intrigued by the specific knowledge I have acquired (more than the certificates). That and the fact that the courses are in English, which implies full fluency in the language.


I can't say for sure, but I think that I've been treated differently from other candidates twice, mainly due to my university, but I think that the Micromasters also had something to do with it.


In one case, I was called by the hiring company's HR and told to come for an interview directly with the manager interested in me, without having participated in any group exercises and evaluation prior (a standard procedure here).


The other case, the manager was present at the group exercise, along with the people from the HR company that was handling the hiring process. He asked me a lot of questions and seemed to have taken an interest in me. Later, the HR company told me that I was one of the candidates they were interested in interviewing, and should be getting a call to set up the date with the manager, but it never came.


Instead, I got a call form the Hiring company's HR, and was told that they needed a few documents from my university to put in my employment contract. I hope to get and sign it next week.


**Edit:** I should have mentioned that I'm hunting for internships."

704,t3_59831n,edX,"Well HarleySport1200, learning is never a waste of time and I would encourage you to take advantage of all of the FREE learning that is available via edX.  Depending on your employer would answer the question on whether or not the certificate is valid.  Many companies in my experience are looking for individuals that can perform the task hired for and not so much the certifications.  If you have certifications, however, that show you have the knowledge and skills to perform those task, then your certification verified via edX would be beneficial.  I've ventured down this road already and have found that many online certification don't mean much to employers.  This is largely in part due to employers not finding online learning websites as a viable institution for learning.  I firmly believe it all depends on you and what you feel is necessary.  I'm currently taking nano-degree courses with Udacity.com and courses on edX.org to help my overall growth potential. I  like what Udacity offers and enjoy the free courses on edX.org.  I will be paying for verified certifications for some of the course on edX, particularly, the CS50 course which will help me with future schooling.  Best of luck on whatever you do, but remember that practice makes better, not perfect."
705,t3_593pbs,edX,"Interesting. I took the first class, passed verified at around 85%, and got the certificate. The 10 week course took a lot out of me though; studying took way too much time in addition to my full-time job. I opted out and stopped taking any more classes. I will say that the first class was interesting, I learned a lot, and after finishing, I wished that I had more time to complete the 5-class series. The TAs were as helpful as I had expected them to be. I usually don't utilize TAs though, even when I was at a real university I didn't. My mentality was that the course was pre-designed and pre-created to be mostly hands-off. I didn't expect the TAs and professors to cater to 30k people when my real professors and TAs in college could only handle a couple hundred.

&gt;I feel I have wasted a great deal of time &amp; effort on a program that is becoming more impossible to complete with every course. Not to mention has NO real-world value: I applied for an entry level internship in supply chain and was told that the MicroMasters credential held no value whatsoever.

I pretty much wasted my time and effort too. But that's because I only took one class. I did benefit from ""re-booting"" my brain though; ever since I took the course I have been able to get into the mindset of studying other material. That's what happens when you graduate college and stop studying for five years, your brain forgets how to learn. If anything, I feel like anyone studying for a MicroMaster should focus on the education and learning aspect, not the financial benefit. Because as of now, the MicroMasters credential holds no value because literally nobody has attained it. The value hasn't been proven yet. I'm not surprised to hear that employers don't value it. The purpose of the MicroMasters is to learn about supply chain and have a minuscule chance of getting into the actual MIT program. If you expected for employers to see the value of the Micromasters when literally nobody has attained it yet, I can see why you are disappointed. At this point, anybody trying to get the MicroMaster is essential an early adopter. And as with any other product, early adopters run the risk of buying into a shoddy product (as well as the opposite, being the first to adopt a great product)"

721,t3_4t14wk,edX,"Well I've paid for many classes on edx and coursera. I can honestly say no one cares about these certs. I have around 36 and I'm a mentor for the iOS Swift course.  I was highly disappointed in some of the classes I paid for and vowed to never pay for another one.  However I actually learn things in these classes and I enjoy them.

I take the stats, linear algebra , machine learning, r type classes and I assure you I'll never get a job I'm those fields. Not thru lack of ability but simply I'm labeled an old man who only knows embedded programming.  

With that said I still take them and my favorite is the coursera iOS objective c series.  

Fwiw I had a recruiter contact me based upon a LinkedIn profile for a machine learning job.  I sent him a resume and he replied I'm looking for a data scientist not a software developer.  I laughed cause what else could I do?

I had another respond for an iot job where he asked if I had any iot experience when I've ported Linux to a network process soc, worked with Bluetooth components via UART on a board running on baremetal and no OS, and have even done aws work.  Not to mention started out with Linux prior to 1.0 kernels and have done drivers and user land apps in Linux.  I was like damn dude there were internet connected devices long before iot became a word.

So if you enjoy learning take all the classes you enjoy but don't take them to get a job.  I just don't think a hr person will consider them relevant.  I even had a smug younger developer make a remark about any thing you have done five years ago is irrelevant.  Mind you I've taken univ level classes at undergrad and grad level on campus simply to keep my skills up and because I enjoy learning new things.  I even poke around and read because it interests me.  However no one has ever explicitly said I'm interested in hiring you because you keep your skills up."

731,t3_4fmonl,edX,"Coursera has always been my top choice, though edX has some nice and unique features.  That said, Coursera is also trying to monetize their students too, though not quite as aggressively as edX from what I've seen.  

If you want to learn an academic topic in the most detail at your own pace but without peer feedback or grades/quizzes, MIT's Open Courseware is a great resource (though less oriented towards professionals, which is where I think MOOCs have major advantages).

I have no problem paying for something worthwhile to support its long-term sustainability.  I'm just skeptical that these credentials or certificates are worth what the MOOCs are asking."

736,t3_43vo9i,edX,"What do you think about the state of patents?


They were created to protect small business from being outplayed by big corporations that have a lot more capital to develop their ideas. However now, big corporations use patents to protect themselves from competition. Some companies don't produce any economic value but hold patents to earn money by suing anyone (patent trolls) and now with the TPP, patents expiration date seems to be being lobbied to last forever."

741,t3_40xtp2,edX,"The course will get very practical and fun very soon! These quizzes that you're referring are just a small part of what they'll show.

Next week we are going to manipulate strings and things like that. We'll work on a little program that calculate credit card interest over a period of time and stuff...

Week 4 we'll program a little word game (like scrable)

This is just the first week! It'll get deeper in a practical way. They will use directed studies to guide us. For example, in one week we will program a little hangman game. They will say ""now you have to do a function that do this:"", and after you get it right you can go to the next section, that is the continuation of the entire program. At the end you'll have a very nice and funcional little hangman program.

And they'll go deeper than that. At the end of the course we will draft some sort of encryption system.

Lots of fun!  "

744,t3_3yb0u6,edX,"
Last I checked, everything is still in Python 2. I took 6.00.1x this past summer and I did a little research since this question came up in the course's forum. Here is my response to the original question ""why 2.7 and not 3.4?"":

They are most likely still using Python 2 for legacy reasons. I did a little digging with Google and came up with a plausible answer. It appears that although the course was first offered on the edX platform in 2012, the curriculum for the edX version is most likely based on the 600 course on the OCW website offered to MIT students in Fall 2008. Python 3 was released towards the end of that semester, in December 2008. So one reason is that the original curriculum was designed before Python 3 was even released.

That being said, I don't think they've stuck with Python 2 out of shear laziness. The primary goal of this course is to teach computer science (e.g logic and flow control, basic data structures, simple algorithms) which doesn't really require any particular programming language.

Even though there are a couple things about Python 3 that really make more sense (most noticeable to me is the print() function and how division is treated), it's probably isn't enough to justify rewriting everything to work with Python 3."
745,t3_3xd807,edX,"Rarely.

EDX is now a store where you buy certificates. In the last months their focus moved to ridiculously easy courses broken in several short parts. Profitwhoring at its best. Still there are a few actually good courses, check them on coursetalk.

But you may be more interested if it will make difference to your employer. This is my firms' HR view: having one formal graduation and knowing a subject in deep count a lot more than 300 introductory MOOCs (and experience before everything else). Also, redundant subjects have no value, unrelated subjects either. Having a few good MOOCs close parallel like hardware for software, management for accounting, etc is good, flooding your CV is not. MOOCs straight at your subject is good if you have no prior experience. No differentiation is made between verified and unverified certificates, as it does not prevent cheating."

We were literally discussing both of these features Friday morning, so it's great to know we have at least one student looking forward to them!

Also, my apologies for the delay in response; r/edX is not intended as an avenue to contact edX Student Support. I've noticed an increase in this type of post, so will create an FAQ or sticky for the sub as soon as I'm able. (Thank you though, and do let me know if this issue still needs attention!)"
765,t3_3nf77z,edX,"Usually that's not possible, but quite often it is possible to upgrade during the first several weeks of the course. "
766,t3_3mf24w,edX,"Hi ! their presentation video has just poped up on the YouTube channel of edX, so I guess they are going to roll back their material pretty soon."
767,t3_3l6yxp,edX,"Great question. I'll try to track down the official answer for you, but I believe that you'd have to pass the AP Calculus exam to get it listed on your high school transcript, regardless of what course you take. Your high school guidance counselor should have more information on this as well. "
768,t3_3l2tlu,edX,"No experience with them, but I would just view then as a +1 education stat on a resume. Nothing to really speak about in an interview."
769,t3_3l4a3n,edX,"Do you mean which course/s might help people looking to help a poor child? 
Unfortunately [Global Poverty](https://www.edx.org/course/challenges-global-poverty-mitx-14-73x) and [Positive Behavior Support for Young Children](https://www.edx.org/course/positive-behavior-support-young-children-uwashingtonx-ecfs312x-0) are both currently archived, but with any archived course you can still enroll to get updates on when it will re-run. 

If you're looking for free courses that will help a child who can't afford the courses, edX has a slew of free courses for students as young as (I believe) 10 years old, including the learn-to-code [Scratch](https://www.edx.org/course/programming-scratch-harveymuddx-cs002x-0) course for all ages, and AP* prep in biology, chemistry, psychology, etc. "
946,t3_y2a1a6,coursera,They kinda complement each other. You get a double badge as they’ve partnered up. I’m doing now and enjoying it. Worth to be honest but A+ is more industry standard.
947,t3_y1qayn,coursera,"I am a dev with no 4 year degree. I got my first role via TripleByte (a recruiting startup) and they famously dont care about resumes.

I did some courses, but they were not really a major contributor to my first job--at least in terms of on-paper appeal.

I learned a lot, from them--but I don't think I was hired because of the certificate itself.

I have been at both Facebook and Amazon, and neither would consider someone without experience (although we have a program at Amazon for training any internal employee to be a developer). Smaller shops are much more likely to take a chance on you."
948,t3_y1ltov,coursera,Apply for financial aid then you get the certificate. Before I learned this I still put the course on my resume. I don’t think they do much. But they’re fun.
949,t3_y15axd,coursera,"I believe most 100% online degree is not eligible for F1, hence no OPT as OPT is part of F1. It is highly unlikely to get H1B thru coursera education imo"
950,t3_y0jgzw,coursera,"I don't know which course you are talking about, but I have never seen any course with that requirement. Even a full-time program would only be 40 hours per week. I would think this is is a typo and relates to the overall course duration."
951,t3_y0a8wb,coursera,"If you are currently enrolled in the course, you won't be able to see the FinAid option, you will need to unenroll, and restart the process"
952,t3_xzsz7k,coursera,"Most likely your subscription will be canceled, but you can restart it with the correct credit cards, your progress will be saved. This is actually very normal."
953,t3_xyurzb,coursera,You will not
954,t3_xyo319,coursera,"The course is free, the membership is not. It’s $40/mo to have access to all of the free courses on the platform. I don’t think there is a way around it. You could maybe fit all of your course work into a week? Or at least a month."
955,t3_xwzz23,coursera,"it depends, did you have an IT related undergrad degree as well? also how much does the job pay, if you're comfortable answering the question"
956,t3_xx0p32,coursera,Hi! You don’t usually have to redo anything that you complete within a free trial. Did you get your certificate? Maybe send their customer services dept. a message to get some clarification over what’s happened?
957,t3_xw7dft,coursera,"The email sent by Coursera is basically telling you that Student Plan account will be closed, and you no longer access free courses using the University student email, **Not personal email accounts.**

If you access Coursera as a normal user, you can access almost every course in the website.

If you enrolled in a course using the Student email account and you haven't finish it yet, you can finish it before november this year.

The progress for any course used in student plan program will be saved, you can re-enroll using your personal account to continue where you left off.

The next step is to add your personal email to your account to enable access for the courses you previously working on the student plan program even after 2 of November this year.

Edit: To be honest, the student plan program was useless, as it offers 1 free course per year, where the normal user can apply for financial aid and wait 15 days to access the course (Maximum number is 10) freely."
958,t3_xw7gaf,coursera,I’m wondering about the financial aid aspect as well. Can we still apply as non-students?
959,t3_xvjbs3,coursera,"There are multiple tabs on your home screen. Your screenshot is probably the Home tab (it's cut off but would be above the screenshot). Click ""In progress"" to see all your courses."
960,t3_xu6x4s,coursera,Can you explain to me how to sign up for the course via financial aid? I want to also do this same course! Thanks!
961,t3_xu8fhy,coursera,No.
962,t3_xsqoud,coursera,"Awesome, thank you! Be sure to put the share link if you're happy with the grades you received. I have a lot of Coursera certificates and it hasn't been unheard of for problematic people to accuse me of lying on my resume. The share link shuts them up quickly, which is why I love it. I wish they had something similar for all the rest of the parts of the resume, like a hiring certificate with a share link that you received when hired at a place of work. Sick and tired of being told the incredibly difficult work I did is somehow subject to ""guilty until proven innocent"". I would of course not even apply to such places if that's the philosophy I knew they ascribed to, against basic justice. Nevertheless I deal with them far more often than is acceptable, demonstrating the power of Coursera's share link."
963,t3_xt8hx1,coursera,"Discussion prompts are optional, you don’t have to complete them to get the certificate."
964,t3_xsk27g,coursera,"Certificates are there to celebrate your achievement of finishing the course, make sure you make the most of your course, do some projects to demonstrate your expertise and you are all set,"
965,t3_xrxboy,coursera,"Not natively in Coursera but you can download an ""ical"" (calendar file) for each course and import them to a software such as Outlook.

BTW they are not 'hard' deadlines in that sense."
966,t3_xrc7nd,coursera,Exactly same issue for me
967,t3_xr8eqp,coursera,"It’s the tech parsing the audio waveforms. They should have a crowdsourced transcript annexing the AI one, and pay people small amounts for scribing and correcting. Then they can go back in and decide which is more accurate. Try floating that idea in an email to support. If they ignore it you might be able to get disability advocacy."
968,t3_xpbwey,coursera,"Congratulations! I’m doing the same one. Did you download all of the sheets and docs to google drive? That’s what I did and created a folder.

Or are you wanting the videos and such?"
969,t3_xp92s8,coursera,"From my experience, it takes about 24 hours for it to get reviewed by someone. My course was Google Project Management so maybe the number of people available was higher."
970,t3_xpb42i,coursera,"I don't think it's that simple, coursera isn't like udemy, they only publish organizations afaik"
971,t3_xm20qd,coursera,How will they connect the two?
972,t3_xlmvts,coursera,"The analytics one was so bad, couldn’t bring myself to finish it"
973,t3_xlqs78,coursera,I believe so.
974,t3_xlbk1k,coursera,"If you’re paying for a monthly subscription, that covers most of their courses. If it’s a degree course, you’d probably need to speak to their customer services department directly to see if they’ll let you swap."
975,t3_xki5m9,coursera,Great question. I am considering doing it as well and I had the same question but mine is business vs IT related. Can anyone help with this?
976,t3_xk0x8j,coursera,I’ve managed to complete quite a few courses within the 7-day trials.
977,t3_xjvnut,coursera,I would add it to your CV. What I do is say when the expected completion date would be. This way employers know that you will have the certification in the near future and could still consider hiring you.
978,t3_xjmf4o,coursera,"""Dog Emotion abd Cognition"" is what you need if you are focusing on a CS education!!"
979,t3_xitf5p,coursera,dm me
980,t3_xijerj,coursera,Maybe try a different browser like chrome and see if the issue still persists
981,t3_xf4ygx,coursera,"I know what you mean. I feel like a lot of people aren't even checking work, just hitting buttons. 

If you message me a link to your project I would be happy to give some feedback."
982,t3_xez5pg,coursera,Nope! The coffee house stuff is just an example project to test concepts on before doing your actual projects. I ended up skipping most of them too around unit 3 or 4 and going straight into my main projects with the lesson info
983,t3_xev76x,coursera,"Find people on LinkedIn that have that and talk to them. 

Or add it to a resume with a different name and similar experience as yours and apply to jobs and see if it helps."
984,t3_xef6uw,coursera,"Yes, you will."
985,t3_xe5psn,coursera,"Hey I am just starting the Data Analytics course and would love a partner, how far along are you?"
986,t3_xddiff,coursera,Usually they offer the option to buy it at the end of modules or locked quizzes. Probably there is an alternative way to buy it in case you don't see it
987,t3_xdg7wb,coursera,Yes. I still have access to my completed course even though I have no more coursera subscription.
988,t3_xcngx4,coursera,"Outside of a subscription, you still get new 7 day free trials for any courses you haven’t started before. I think all of the courses require a subscription after the trial, except the degree courses."
989,t3_xcagnr,coursera,If you audited the course you can apply for financial aid anytime
990,t3_xaywmt,coursera,Click on enroll then hit hit audit
991,t3_xanfv6,coursera,"They’re not useless. Apart from then in-depth knowledge they offer, some universities take it for credit. The IT SUPPORT in particular is very popular. I used it for my WGU admissions and though it only took care of the 4 credits for Intro to IT, it’s something at least."
992,t3_xaso61,coursera,I used Coursera as supplemental material for the more difficult courses in my CS degree. Maybe use Coursera to learn new skills and build an online portfolio (website/GitHub) for interviews/LinkedIn?
993,t3_x92fjz,coursera,"When I had this problem (it's been a couple of years now), I had to contact Qwicklabs themselves and they were able to get me access to some things, but simply passed me for others without actually having done that (which was a disservice)."
994,t3_x8zdns,coursera,"No, it doesn't roll over. Financial aid is specific for each course you apply. 

If you finish before the allotted time I have no idea what will happen though 🤔"
995,t3_x90o0m,coursera,"Just search the course in coursera and then click audit. If it says your aid will be cancelled once enrolled, just ignore that it is only for those who are in the free trial period."
996,t3_x8mcwl,coursera,Anything google or cloud should help one get hired
997,t3_x8b1vv,coursera,"They are, but be aware that most of them are in competitive fields or ones with strict hiring requirements where a vocational certificate from an institution with mediocre respect like Coursera doesn't make you a shoo-in for a job. Like, if you go to to a community college and get a nurse aide or hvac technician certificate, finding a job will be really easy because of the nature of those careers."
998,t3_x7adwr,coursera,Maybe reach out to a recruiter from Facebook on LinkedIn and see what they say. They may have a certain number of positions set aside for people who complete the course.
999,t3_x6ir83,coursera,Yes. You can even do the quiz and just write down your answers in word then submit the quiz when you have full access so you don’t forget everything.
1000,t3_x6amv5,coursera,Yes
1001,t3_x4m1zb,coursera,"This is a technical issue with their platform so no one here can really assist you.   
I'd contact support again and let them know your issue hasn't been resolved as a support ticket should't be closed before the issue has been resolved."
1002,t3_x2v6gy,coursera,"The monthly vs. fee per course appears to just be a decision by the course creator. Most are monthly subscription, there's a few flat fee courses out there still. The monthly sub doesn't automatically include every course, it only includes the specific course or specialization when you sign up on the course/specialization page. 

The exception is courses in Coursera Plus, which is a subscription service with thousands of courses. To clarify, even if a course is in CourseraPlus, you can still sign up for it individually for cheaper on the course page. I've completed 2 specializations, neither are in Coursera Plus. 

The certificates that you've completed should be in your ""accomplishments"" section, they don't go away when you stop paying. I've seen Coursera even auto-cancel my subscription when I completed a specialization. Sounds like maybe they just scrubbed that course completely from their platform, you'd have to ask them."
1003,t3_x1c51x,coursera,Agree. I join courses just so I don’t forget about them.
1004,t3_x0ohi7,coursera,I have already applied for about 50 courses and selected 0$ as the option. All my applications got approved so far.
1005,t3_x0ctnt,coursera,"Huh, I never upload pngs for this course. Try compiling everything into 1 pdf file."
1006,t3_x02v52,coursera,"Contact support, say you made a mistake and ask for advice on how you should proceed.

1010,t3_wz96jq,coursera,"It depends on your university that you want to transfer the credits to tbh . Some might accept the same certificate while others don't (even if it has ACE accreditation or college credit). You can't expect them to just fit a random course you took towards your degree. So what I would do is call the school or if they have a partner's page before taking anything on coursera, and if you already did, I would ask whether my certificate is transferable towards my degree or not. or maybe submit an evaluation. Hope this helps!"
1011,t3_wz5807,coursera,"The course appears to be relativley new so there will probably not be too many reviews online about it. Worth it is relative, if you don't do this course what will you do? What do you hope to gain out of this course?"

I guess it will be the same with you. If you convince whoever reads it that it makes sense for you to get the financial aid, you will get it."
1025,t3_wtk4cd,coursera,I finished the first course within the free trial period and I got the certificate and I wasn't charged.

1028,t3_ws96dr,coursera,Data Visualization Best Practices by UCI right now and NO ONE has interacted with the class at all.  Unlike all other classes  I've taken here.
1029,t3_wrw3pt,coursera,"I use Coursera to get an overview of a subject. I recently took the IBM Data Engineer Certification but did not complete it. I don't mind not getting the certification as I don't think it is worth much in the industry. In my opinion, the only certifications that have value are those from vendors like Oracle, AWS, Databricks, Google, Microsoft, ...

  
Another reason that I think devalues Coursera certificates is that I now know how to work around the system. Whenever you want to complete a project, you have to submit your assignment. But before you can submit it, you have to grade 1 or 2 of other cadidates. In theory, this is a good move by Coursera.

  
BUT, I received some submissions from other candidates who just uploaded the same meaningless screenshot. And why? Because it allows them to see other candidates' assignments. Chances are very high that the majority will take this certificate seriously and put time and effort into the project/task. But the candidates with meaningless screenshots now have the opportunity to see the solved tasks, copy/paste them, reassign them and pass them, module by module. So I don't think you should expect too much from these Coursera certificates.

  
They are worth a little bit because at least they show that someone is willing to invest some extra (private) time in a subject and try to get ahead in their career. But that's about it."

1037,t3_wmxhku,coursera,"There are two different things - the Specialization certificate (which you need to be a paying member of coursera in order to get) and the Google Certification itself, for which you need to take the exam. The specialization is to prepare you for the exam, but its certificate isn't the same thing as the Google Certified Cloud Architect certification.

Same applies to all the other specialisations that are prep for a certification exam. Google and others  (e.g. there's a Microsoft data engineering specialisation but that doesn't in itself give you the certified Associate Data Engineer Microsoft cert)"

1040,t3_wl12ks,coursera,Did you ask inside the discussion forms for help ?
1041,t3_wke6lb,coursera,"Hi. Its been 11 days since you asked but its your cake day rn so happy cake day. I am on week 3 of course 4 of the Duke university Intro to C spec and it has been great. Very frustrating at times, specially when you try to guess test cases from the given instructions. If you stick to the methodologies and take a lot of notes it won't be an issue, at least that works for me.

It's pretty basic right until pointers and malloc (courses 3 and 4) where it gets hairy but I've learned a lot and made me a better programmer overall. Other skills you learn along the way are git, algorithms, data structures, string manipulation, debugging, unix-like systems and emacs."
1042,t3_wk59ed,coursera,I finished it about two weeks ago. What’s up?
1043,t3_wjx9dm,coursera,"I think you can continue to look at the materials, but the course completion is still on the record associated with your account."
1044,t3_wjz9hl,coursera,"Why not jusst do both? Do the one they suggest, and then the one you want for your portfolio? Thats what I am doing."
1045,t3_wjvg90,coursera,"I have no idea if they will unlink your certifications if you end the paid subscription. I am also worried about it, but figure you should still be able to save/download the certification/badge and upload it yourself where you want it. I think the best work-around is to try to land an entry-level job before the subscription runs out and then no one will really care about the certifications because actual job experience should mean more than their certifications."
1046,t3_wjfrx7,coursera,I took the project management course and had the same thing happen to me. Just resubmit as is and wait to be reviewed again. You can go on the discussions and post your link too to bump it up so more people see it.
1047,t3_wjd34g,coursera,"This happend to me once with google cloud courses when they were free (on promotion).

1049,t3_wixnsa,coursera,"I have no idea which coarses are available.

But if you want to be a good and loved leader, you have to love your people. (To love =&gt; putting energy into improving the welfare =&gt; less stress / depression =&gt; people are happy and energetic people and want to improve global welfare).

So psychology and philosophy. You need to fill the basic needs of people so they have room to fulfill their other needs and the needs of the world. 

You can see countries as individuals, just as people. With their own traumas and needs. World leadership is knowing what each individual country needs to grow into the best version of itself and guide them to the right path."
1050,t3_wia6uv,coursera,AFAIK you only get charged for the time you use. So finish it in one month &amp; you save a lot.

1057,t3_weqm0q,coursera,"Any class won't get you a job. Once you finish that certificate, start building things &amp; pushing them to GitHub. That gives you something to show recruiters as proof you know what you're doing."
1058,t3_weef7p,coursera,"no, you don't have access to all of the courses with the coursera plus, but most of them.

But if you want a personnal advice, you don't really need a coursera plus sub, you can get almost all courses for free, provided that you apply for financial aids for each course.  but if you don't want the hassle of doing that everytime and waiting 2 weeks everytime, coursera plus is a good option, especially if you have a lot of free time and can do multiple courses at the same time.

That's only true if they're in the same specialization/certificate or they're part of the Coursera Plus program that you might be subscribed to. In other words, I can't subscribe to Google's Data Analytics Certificate program then start doing the courses in the IBM Data Analytics Certificate program with the same subscription.

1068,t3_w8powp,coursera,Hi! After your last payment you'll just not have access to the graded assignments anymore.
1069,t3_w8doqs,coursera,"I've taken Google and IBM courses, and they all allowed auditing. Meaning, you can see almost all of the course without ever being a subscriber. The main thing you cannot do is submit graded assignments. You can look at your best graded test result if it's a course you took before while subscribed and had submitted a test for. Also, you can just look at the test without being able to submit anything. If it's a graded external assignment (you do it on a different website), I don't think you can access it at all without being subscribed. 

There are some courses that don't allow audits. For those courses, I'm not sure if they let you go back and look."
1070,t3_w7qk1u,coursera,Cancel and apply for financial aid.

1073,t3_w5g8d8,coursera,"Lol I looked up this sub for the same issue I was having.

Turns out we're looking at a ""specialization"" - which I guess can't be ""audited""? 

Scroll down to the list of courses in the specialization and now I see the audit option"
1074,t3_w51r8u,coursera,"Financial aid applies only to one course part of a specialization, but you can apply again for financial aid for any subsequent courses. It usually takes 15 days for them to approve your financial aid, but you can start working on the course beforehand just by choosing the audit button. There is no limit to how many hours you can spend studying the course, so you can easily go through a course in a day to a day and a half if you apply yourself to the task."
1075,t3_w4spqk,coursera,"If I'm not mistaken, this certification is composed of 8 courses. You have to apply a financial aid in each course since you cannot apply in it as a whole. Check which course you were able to get the financial aid. You can check that somewhere in your account."
1076,t3_w3qdsq,coursera,I hate to say it but have you tried a faster computer or a different browser?
1077,t3_w3qdr3,coursera,You could potentially download videos for offline use and then watch them if you’re worried about your company doing other trainings on company time.
1078,t3_w417ou,coursera,"you can use the community chat . and post your assignment url and ask for a review.

Edit: words"
1081,t3_w0l3md,coursera,"It’s a good way to show you have a certified skill in something. In the world where everything you say and are is guilty of fraud until proven innocent, it’s a good way to get employers to calm their heaving bosoms a little. In addition, it’s a great way to stop being bored without hating yourself for spending time on time sinks."
1082,t3_w01hhj,coursera,"Depends, the best studying experts actually advise you to take multiple courses or study multiple things at the same time

I learned this on Coursera funny enough from Learning how to Learn by Barbara Oakley.

It's called interleaving, and consists in mixing and switching between multiple subjects, topics, and problems, in order to give the mind time to consolidate the knowledge and also create patterns in between.

For example, if I'm studying math and physics, instead of focusing on math or physics, it would be better to do 1 hour of physics and then 1 hour of math (order and time doesn't matter as long as you switch), and then by the end of the day you will have learned more and also will be able to recall much more and create more connections between the physics and math.

1084,t3_vzd26c,coursera,"Honestly I find the site very confusing. Some classes you can audit, some you can't? But it's not obvious which ones are which? In THEORY, you can audit a course and then sign up for a certificate and then you have to complete all the assignments you didn't have to do with an audit. But I dunno... they all seem to be pushing for signing up for the 7-day trial and I think they take a credit card number when you do that."
1085,t3_vz4s85,coursera,Did you cancel your subscription? If not you got charged or you can audit the class but can't get the certificate
1086,t3_vxk7jm,coursera,"You have to cancel your current subscription if you want to pause it. All of your progress will be saved.

You can have multiple subscriptions simultaneously."
1087,t3_vxh593,coursera,"You will need to apply for financial aid for each individually. So, do it now. Don’t be like me, who was all excited about finishing a course, went to start the next one, and realized I’ll have to wait two weeks. :/"

Interesting how so many people cooperate to throw the system without even interacting. And the programs through prestigious universities are also losing a lot of caché according to an article I read in the WSJ."
1093,t3_vvufz7,coursera,"masters on coursera, edx etc... all are paid masters, you can theoretically do micromasters and do them by applying to financial aids, and as you said yes, it counts towards credits, but even if some courses are removed from the master's track, it's still expensive, it can go 20 000$ +

If you want to do an online master's degree at an affordable price, you should check University of the People, they are tuition free, but you have to pay 300$ at the end of each course you complete, the total amount goes around 4000$, which is better than any other alternative out there, they are the only ones that do that in the US as far as I know.

In their website , they advertise the fact that you can apply to their scolarships and get one to cover all of the expenses, while this is definitely true for their bachelor's degree, it's not true at all for the master's. I know that because I applied to it and got declined because they told me they give priority to people who don't have a degree yet, and that it's not available for master's for now (I think the exception could be if you'r applying for a master's of education, I believe there is a scholarship for that)

Other than them, you could find other tuition free master's tho there are too few of them, an other one is the university of edinburgh in the UK, but I believe the applications are closed already, they finished sometime around june I believe."
1094,t3_vvwrvu,coursera,"I don't think you need to add ""via coursera"" if you don't want to. As long as you have the certificate ID and/ or the link to verify the certificate in the resume, it shouldn't be an issue really."
1095,t3_vvnbk5,coursera,"If 180 days passed since you got the course for free and haven't finished it in that time period, you can apply for another financial aid, and Coursera will surely approve of it again. And your progress won't be lost, so you can continue where you left off. 😊"

a lot of people sign up and setup the direct debit because they are feeling all motivated and then don't even bother going and they always delay cancelling the direct debit because "" theyl start Monday"" lol..

I think coursera realises theres most likely more money to be made by enticing people to setup direct debit with a small monthly charge rather than 1 big payment.

in short i think if you are going to put your head down and get on with courses then i would say the cost of coursera is good, much more affordable to pay this way than 1 big payment for each certificate. 

p.s if you are in the UK and you meet a certain criteria you could get free funding to do courses on coursera."

1152,t3_v71zzb,coursera,This cert won’t give you much. It’s a nice little dip into IT but is mostly worthless. If you can do it within a month I say go for it. Other than that studying for and getting the CompTia A+ cert is better.

1157,t3_v4iufe,coursera,"Super flawed. I got flagged for plagiarism on a peer reviewed assignment that was written by me weeks prior, but I rewrote it in a panic, then got flagged again and booted out of the course. Coursera acted like it was a shut case and no more could be done, but thankfully I pressured them for more info after seeing on this sub that people were falsely flagging and stealing people’s assignments. They then came back saying it wasn’t plagiarized after another review. I don’t understand their system but do know it’s very flawed.

Don’t even get me started on the grading. Based on the submissions I’ve reviewed I’m shocked that they let people that can’t follow basic instructions grade other people’s work."

I completed the first 2 specializations back in college :)

&amp;#x200B;

Start with the first Specialization.

It will help you learn about Java programming in general + Object Oriented Programming.

Each course has a really nice project to work on. The lectures are concise and informative. 

Yes, you might find the latter courses a little difficult, but trust me - it's worth it.

&amp;#x200B;

1172,t3_uunrjw,coursera,You have free trial of one week for specializations. You get to keep the certificates of the courses you do in that time.
1173,t3_utkbzq,coursera,I took the Google IT course. Once I finished this I was able to get a job with TEKsystems. The cert by itself did not get me the job but it did give me the courage to start looking and applying. Had to take additional testing with TEKsystems so they saw I knew what I knew.
1174,t3_utbfzw,coursera,"Coursera Plus Is a different subscription. You need to cancel the subscription to the single course. You should still be in your free cancellation period?

Then you subscribe to Coursera Plus.

THEN you go back to that course and enroll. 

You will be able to enroll in all Coursera Plus courses without any additional payment.
I don't believe there is a Coursera Plus subscription link from the actual course page? I googled it and found the subscription page that way.

In the FAQs, they explain that you have to cancel the regular subscription as they will happily charge you for that AND the Plus subscription at the same time, until you cancel one, or both.

I know shit gets tough sometimes and you can feel overwhelmed. It seems to me that you may be putting a lot of things off until they demand your attention (relationships, school) by blowing up.

You aren't in the right mindspace to be learning right now. You are feeling desperate. You chose to cheat instead of learn. Why? Your personal and financial problems. That is totally understandable. Finance is a huge stressor. But at the end of the day you aren't going to make this class work continuing on as is --- you need to mend the issues in your life that are conflicting with school before you can learn.

1193,t3_uh4mvk,coursera,"From what I’ve noticed, they are essentially online degrees from the institutions that are providing the services and education via Coursera - you’ll notice you’ll be paying about what an online tuition would cost.

1195,t3_ug91em,coursera,"You might not be able to access graded content while you're auditing. But you could work through all the lesson material, prepare for the assessments, and then pay and quickly take them all. For peer-graded assignments, you could complete them and then wait until you pay to submit them all. But, peer review can be frustratingly slow. You also might run into problems with timing, where Coursera says ""join now"" because the course ""starts today"" but it actually doesn't, and everything past the first week is locked. If that happens to you, go to the Help Center and ask them to switch you into a session that started earlier and is already further along. 

If your specialization has multiple courses, you can overlap them. I did that and it helped me to finish the specialization in less than the recommended time (and therefore spend less on monthly fees.) 

I know that many people choose to be frugal even when they don't need to be. I'm the same way. But if $60 or whatever is actually a lot to swing for you, there's nothing wrong with asking for financial aid."
1196,t3_uff0ls,coursera,"This is a good question. I think you can expect an email from coursera when the time comes with instructions regarding your situation. I got a similar email from them recently and it was stated that even though I lost my subscription after 7 days, I will still keep all of my progress when I subscribe again. 

so I think the important thing is that you will not lose your progress but for the ""extension"" part, I am not so sure. You might simply have to enroll again if you want to finish your courses.

1207,t3_u6iqek,coursera,"The badge you get at the end of the specialization will help you get at the top of searches (at least in LinkedIn), but in the end you have to back it up with a good portfolio of projects. The capstone will ask you to complete a case study that you can showcase after.

As an alternative, you can get a 7 day free trial and push through all the graded assignments and essentially get your certification for free. Keep in mind that other users have said that Coursera can refuse your certification if you go through this method too fast (completing an entire certification in 15 minutes), but I completed mine in roughly 6 days and have had zero issue."
1210,t3_u59a54,coursera,"Coursera, in my mind, should be considered a supplement to something else in order to boost your resume. Ideally, a candidate with classroom experience (not necessarily a full degree), hands=on experience, and some certificates is perfect. The primary issue with applying for jobs with *only* a Coursera certificate is that it only proves that you can answer questions about subject x - it doesn't tell the hiring manager how well you actually perform in the environment you'd be in. 

&amp;#x200B;

At the end of the day, we're all chasing a job. A candidate who has a full resume with lots to offer will easily get picked over someone who only lists a few Coursera courses and no experience. With that being said, experience can be hard to come by. Thus, I'd recommend proving your skills through different methods, such as building a portfolio or starting an in-depth blog. This way, if your resume is good, the hiring manager will look at your information and determine how much you actually know about the subject."
1211,t3_u4jeey,coursera,"If I remember correctly, all of the courses that ""require"" a VM have one built-in, using Google's Qwiklabs. The screen will effectively split into two - with one being the VM and the other having the instructions. 

Using any laptop is the best option, in my view. When you're driving, it's closed and stored. When parked, you just whip it out, connect to Wi-Fi, and go forth. The screen on your car's ceiling is...interesting. The keyboard on your lap sounds uncomfortable, and a mouse...somewhere, sounds interesting. A basic laptop will contain all of that in a relatively ergonomic format. 

I'm not sure about tablets - so long as the Browser detects that you're not on a smartphone it should work. Notably, I tried running one of the VMs on my phone using the ""Show Desktop site"" option, but Coursera recognized it as a mobile device and didn't allow me to proceed."
1212,t3_u4bz5s,coursera,I only wish more governments took this enlightened approach.
1213,t3_u3xs0z,coursera,"I think so. The free trial access lasts for seven days. Canceling only stops Coursera from charging you past the trial period. I'm not too sure about this, though. Why not just set a reminder a day before your trial expires.  


Regarding the certificate, I've read somewhere that you can't access capstone projects with only free trial access. You can finish a course and get a certificate, but you can't get a specialization certificate from a Specialization that has a capstone project."
1214,t3_u3imqb,coursera,"How about the quality of the courses and learning materials? Was it up to par with your expectations?

Make sure to mention why you can't pay and be honest about it in the financial aid application.

1218,t3_u12yy7,coursera,"The short answer: it's both but the two are not identical — a **user journey is a tool, not a specific phase**. The core concept of the user journey is to *map out what the user goes through* so both make sense.   
This is because the design thinking process is iterative and you can have multiple user journeys with different focuses. In the need-finding portion where you are trying to figure out what your user goals are, you can use user journey to map out the journey before the product and after you figure out the goal and are ideating for the solution, create a journey where the user is using the product so it is easy to visualize when creating a prototype.  


Just remember, the user journey is a tool to help you ideate, define, and visualize. There is not really a clear-cut order of where you need a user journey."
1219,t3_u0qru4,coursera,"If your portfolio has complete case studies of your ux designs then you could use those, but if it's only designs then it's be best to go through the course.

The case study includes artifacts from all aspects of the design thinking process and designs alone only account for the last 2 of 5 stages, so you'd be missing out a lot. 

If you're not familiar with the entire design thinking process, I'd advise you not to even attempt backtracking from your designs because the aim of design thinking is to build a product from the customer's perspective and not to get customers for a product you have built..if you get me (trying to fit a target audience for your product).

I completed the UX course yesterday and I have gained so much insight into finding out what the customer truly wants."

Because I choose a Specialisation course I have five courses in it each one Show four weeks in it so it’s 20 weeks and it’s a lot of to read and do so there is no way someone will finish everything in a month.  What I also don’t understand is in this course but I wanna take there are assignments that Required peer Assignment and also it show That I need to pick up a subject a topic and make an assignment on it through the whole course which mean to the whole  five courses. That assignment it says I need to investigate and read more and find other sources and he look like it will be much longer than the course itself…
There is no way that someone will finish a course that fast and pay only for one month $49 they know people cannot finish it and they know that it will take longer which mean more money I like the courses they’re interesting what you look like assignments we need to take the amount of material we need to read it is too much. at least for me…."

Coursera tried to ride the woke train and said they're doing to support Ukraine, but they are not allowed to offer services to countries that the US has sanctions against.

For this specialization you don't need any specific software, until the last course where you'll need ro download and install R and Rstudio (but don't worry, you'll get all the instructions once you get there). 


The whole specialization is very straightforward, you'll get all the info you need from the videos and specified recommended readings. There are no peer graded projects, only graded quizes, one for each week and a course challenge quiz. Almost every course is 4-5 weeks long and only one is 6 weeks long, but it's easy to finish then in way less time.


For the first courses you'll be using mainly google sheets and google cloud (for SQL, in one course they'll give you instructions to access for free), you can also use MS excel if you want instead of google sheets.


For note taking you can use simply pen and paper or take digital notes if you like. The quizzes are not that hard. 


Consistency is key, set up a specific time of the day for learning and stick to your schedule. If you ever get stuck check out the discussion forums or look up info online, but you probably won't need more material than what is presented in each course.


Good luck and have fun learning!"

As for Coursera courses the Google Data Analytics specialisation looks good. I think it has a fair amount of Python programming involved but may teach you the basics to get going with it. If not take a look at a beginner Python course."
1347,t3_s1seqn,coursera,I usually go to Discussion forums to see if there are students begging to get reviewed there.
1348,t3_s1js4z,coursera,I have only seen it last New Year's and this New Year's. I don't think it came up in between these two times.
1349,t3_s19cgr,coursera,Nope
1350,t3_s18saf,coursera,"Well, you usually don't need any camera or lights to learn online."
1351,t3_s0qvg5,coursera,You're 100% dead-on correct. Its about profit and not about their students. I just called my bank to stop payments for Coursera. That company really HATES their customers. I have tried for days to try and find a customer service person with a pulse. Not possible. I was a third of the way finished with the UX Certificate when my entire account was wiped out - Gone ! Tried to contact Coursera for days; no way to contact a live person. Do not use this company; it's obvious that they really hate the thought of having their customers talk to  them !
1352,t3_s0pnbe,coursera,"I’ve been having issues scrolling when inside a course, but only when I use my laptop. The chat support is very nice and both times I reached out they replied fairly quickly and said it was a known issue, but it still hasn’t been fixed and they don’t have an eta. So I’m iffy on how I feel about them."
1353,t3_s0ev4f,coursera,"You have to pay for the certificate
You can view course material but not exams in audit mode
You can apply for financial aid  , it take 15 days to be approved, you can assit in audit mode untel you get approval,
Search internet for ""coursera financial aid example"" you will get how to make it"
1354,t3_s0dxsb,coursera,"Have you purchased the course? If yes, then you can't. If no then you can unenroll from the website."

1356,t3_rx6i0g,coursera,"just go for it you will never regret it, and after you finish it and want to broaden you expertise you can do the IBM course too. believe me you will be happy."
1357,t3_rwfjha,coursera,I would give it a day or two more and then post this question on the class forum. I'm sure traffic on Coursera was light due to the holidays thus few people doing reviews.
1358,t3_rw6m3y,coursera,Just apply for Financial Aid. There is no guarantee you'll get the $39/month rate again.
1359,t3_rvrap4,coursera,"Yes you can, you probably enroll the course as “audit “ wherein you have access to videos but you can not submit quiz or graded assignments, however if you wish to have certificate, you can pay for it and and earn the certificate."
1360,t3_ruznuq,coursera,"Chat with support, no point taking the risk if someone is wrong here."
1361,t3_rv364n,coursera,"For the Google certs, each section is considered a course. You need to apply for financial aid for each section separately."
1362,t3_ruxgaj,coursera,I have taken more than 10 so far so I don't think there is a limit.
1363,t3_ruzl7y,coursera,"If you're experiencing financial hardship, just be honest about your situation and you'll get it."
1364,t3_rujb9a,coursera,"Doing a little research it looks like their student program allows you to take one free course per year. They do consider each of the 5 components a separate course. 

Since you are a student you may be able to apply for the financial aid program they have. From my understanding you would again need to apply for it separately for each course but it may be an option to complete the certification for a reduced cost or free."
1365,t3_ruidfn,coursera,"AFAIK 

1. You can reset the course deadline as long as your a subscribe or have to the course. 

2. As long as you have access or subscribed to the course.

3. Depending on the course, usually have 3 takes every 24 hours."
1366,t3_rug7h0,coursera,"I will say apply for the financial aid , it is more simple"
1367,t3_rtw13r,coursera,I’ve been able to buy more than 1 before! Not sure if that’s changed lately but right now I’m doing 2 courses that I paid for

1369,t3_rtg697,coursera,"Should be alright - I put it in the section which is something like 'Certifications' rather than university education, then it is clear. It is a bit like people will physically go to universities and take management programmes etc."
1370,t3_rtfyyi,coursera,The post was removed because it's a duplicate
1371,t3_rt2zkc,coursera,"Yea, I agree there is a need to redesign the entire dashboard. I used to search my other enrolled classes, I had to scroll through each page to find that one course. Now I just don't bother doing it and saved my latest progression as a bookmark on my chrome tab."
1372,t3_rssj4q,coursera,"As you said, you have had several interviews, so it looks like the problem you have is how you have performed in those interviews. The problem would be much worse if you couldn't get any interview.

 I would probably go with Coursera, udemy, datacamp or similar platforms and start doing projects to have a portfolio to show on GitHub. Especially if you have some experience in Python."
1373,t3_rsskhi,coursera,"There is a field in the form where you can type in how much you can give. If you want you can type in zero there and you won't be a charge a penny. Once your application is verified, the whole course content will be unlocked including the assignments and you would get a certificate upon completion of the course. Also, there is no time limit, so you can progress at your own pace"
1374,t3_rses0s,coursera,"Due dates can be extended at any time, so don't worry about them. They are a motivational tool. However, be aware that you only have access to each course for 6 months, so if it takes you longer than that, you'll have to reapply for financial aid."
1375,t3_rr9sos,coursera,try reaching their customer service using their chat options. I had to change my email id and they merge my email ids.
1376,t3_rqwtgq,coursera,"I used Coursera for several years and have just recently come back to it because I want to start a career as a data scientist. Currently, I’m a professional retail investor and am self employed. I’m looking to spend the next 2 years learning advanced technical skills from Google and Google Cloud. I know this isn’t what you wanted. I’m currently 26 FYI and a college graduate."

Hope that helps, message if you have any question"
1380,t3_robal3,coursera,You can enroll in one course at a time and get the certificate for that course. No need to enroll and pay for the whole specialization
1381,t3_rn8md2,coursera,Please stay away from this company. The same thing happened to me too way too many times. They just randomly wipe out students' progress as they wish. The specialists that they have are no good and unable to solve anything. Really unethical way of running a business
1382,t3_rn0le6,coursera,"I read the review. Thanks but do you have any information on grading? I hear it is peer-graded like they do at UofPeople. Also, it seems we can take one free course per year for university students. Does that mean we can get the full certificate as well or would we pay for the certificate? I assume it comes with the free offer.

“The Coursera for Campus Student plan allows individual university and college students to sign up for unlimited Guided Projects and one free course per year”"
1383,t3_rmnisl,coursera,Maybe try after the 7day period

1385,t3_rlbjw6,coursera,"I just finished the IT course by Google. Yes, each section clearly shows what is graded. As long as you do those you get a pass for the week. I skipped a few sections that way since it was all review for me."

1390,t3_rj3h5s,coursera,Do you still have the achievments/badge for completing the other courses? If you still have them I think there's no problem
1391,t3_rib9ck,coursera,"Graduate certificates are not part of Coursera Plus. You would have to pay for the grad certificate separately if you decide to sign up. The admission rules for this certificate come from the University of London, not Coursera."
1392,t3_rggc9w,coursera,"but when you enter to the course doesn't show you as complete?
if it doesn't i think you can apply again  !:)"
1393,t3_rgajmk,coursera,"The answer is no. When you cancel, you keep certificates but lose access to the courses. If you resubscribe, you will regain access to those courses along with the progress you have made.

Coursera Plus allows you to take majority of Specializations on the platform (no additional fees.) Some course providers are not covered by Plus, like University of Virginia and IBM, which is why their course pages will show that their lessons are $39 or 49/month to access.

You can't buy individual courses."
1394,t3_rdfl75,coursera,"Yes, but there is only one of you."
1395,t3_rd6ozx,coursera,What was last year's discount rate?
1396,t3_rc7t0e,coursera,"Not me, but my girlfriend actually started an IT specialist course and after half of the course she applied for a job and now she's been working as an IT support analyst for almost 4 months so I believe you can find a job.
You just need to believe in yourself and believe me there's a lot of people that have degrees from recognized universities but don't have the life experience that needed more specially in this world nowadays
Good luck"

1406,t3_r7bqnn,coursera,"It sounds like the open-ended questions that you do only for yourself. Things like ""what do you think is most important in the work culture"", or journals of your progress, etc. They don't contribute to your passing/failing. Those are only for you to keep engaged. Maybe for some internal analytics or for course instructors if they want to look if there is a way to improve (?). If you go to the ""grades"" tab in the left menu, you'll see which quizzes and exercises contribute to your actual score."

Coursera support on qwiklab issues is terrible, numerous people complaining about the same issue in the discussion forms; yet we need to contact qwiklabs individually, makes no sense to me."
1410,t3_r41v6e,coursera,"I just dropped out of my coursera UX design specialization for this reason. I worked really hard on my first assignment and thought it met all the grading criteria. I spent a lot of time trying to provide my peers with valuable feedback on their assignments... when I got the grade back for my own submission, I got a failing grade and the written feedback literally said things like “yes.” And “ok.” So i have no idea if they actually didn’t understand my designs or if they were just lazily grading

I decided to use the learning material and just do my own projects for a portfolio. If I’m not gonna get feedback on coursera, i May as well just work on something I actually want to do"

If you don't submit every graded test in time, you can reset your deadlines, so it's not a problem. BUT you have to complete the course before the date shown in the link I gave you."
1416,t3_r0bk84,coursera,"Hey! I finished the course a few months ago. It's great to give you some new insights about how to learn, but I would say it's way too introductory.

By the way, I'm a Medical student (2nd year in Europe) and I think I'm enjoying technology more and more every day, to the point of thinking about getting a degree in that area.

1438,t3_qqsvwl,coursera,"Hi :) I think it would be really hard. Up to recently there was some backdoor option to develop some content for Coursera, and it was a way to start an official collaboration... but you're a few minutes late for that: [Coursera Shuts Down Community Guided Projects](https://www.classcentral.com/report/community-guided-projects-shutdown/). I think you'd need to collaborate with some institution to make it happen. It doesn't need to be university, since not all partners are... but you'd assume that there will be a lot of emails and meetings before it happens.  


Udacity has a [become an instructor](https://www.udacity.com/instructors/build-with-udacity) form. If they will be interested, there is a chance that you'll be asked to develop a course or part of it. But screening process may take some time, and there is no guaranty that anyone will get back to you.  


The best option for you seems to be [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/teaching/?ref=teach_header) or [Skillshare](https://www.skillshare.com/teach)  \- both platforms have independent courses, and have an established track to submit and sell them."
1439,t3_qq3yih,coursera,"I faced something similar..
I payed for a specialisation course. Finished it a week ago. And I was searching everywhere on the website to find the certificates.  
Under Achievements, they had the Buy Certificate option..
I was infuriated, thinking that they fooled me..and now I would need to pay more to get the certificates. 
But then, I realised I have not verified my ID using the Verify ID thingy they have (they use yr passport or national ID to verify u as a person and then use that name for the certificates).
After I verified, my certificates were available. 
Try that out n see how it works"

1443,t3_qmhodr,coursera,"I am currently doing the [University of Michigan Applied Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python).

Reviews so far:

1. **Introduction** \- Really damn good. Cleared up my concepts really well. They recommended some experience in python beforehand, but I still did well regardless and picked it along the way from the course hints, and some manual searching. (I have a background in CS, and I am a nerd, so consider that.)
2. **Matplotlib** \- I didn't enjoy the tutorials as much as the first course. Went from 0 to 100 really quick. The questions seemed a bit tough due to the same reason, but the quality of the questions and the insights provided in the lectures was really good. Just do some external research and documentation reading, use StackOverflow.
3. **Applied Machine Learning** \- Currently in Week 2. Loving it so far! It's a little longer than the previous ones, and the pacing is really great, cleared up the basics really well as well.

As for the rest, I'll update this comment and make a post when I am done.

P.S. Personally, I don't recommend the others like [IBM Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science), or the [Johns Hopkins Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) one because: 

1) I did a little bit of the IBM course on EDx, and the quality was lacking. Not to mention IBM Watson Cloud (where you'll spend a lotta time with the IBM Course was kinda inconvenient.) 

2) The Johns Hopkins University course is in R, and I prefer Python for too many reasons. (and I HIGHLY recommend starting out with Python instead of R.)"
1444,t3_qmar9v,coursera,[deleted]
1445,t3_qmcsnp,coursera,Were you able to get an answer? I'm curious and I know this sub doesn't have a lot of people
1446,t3_qm8d6l,coursera,I'm interested as well.
1447,t3_qm5g0o,coursera,I'd recommend to contact support to validate the authenticity of the email address.
1448,t3_qlzfq7,coursera,"For the most part, those courses are legit. You learn as much (or as little) as in a University course. But the class is not 25 people but 10,000, so they can be much cheaper. By the price, I'm guessing that you're referring to Google UX Design Professional Certificate, by Google right? Those are a little more practice-oriented than the usual academic courses... Google makes great courses, you'll end up with actual knowledge. But it's, and I can't stress it enough, **entry** level. The assumption is that you don't know anything, so by the end, you'll know the basics.  


How does it work in general? Most of the courses at Coursera contain at minimum:

\- videos with lectures, usually in 5-15 minute prices  
\- thing to read  
\- some tests  


In paid versions, you'll also get access to the very unintuitive forum, and some exercise that is more than just A/B test. It'll probably be peer audited. You'll check someone's work if it meets project criteria, someone else will check yours.  


Long story short. Start with free. If you're looking for certification, you may need to pay for something. If you're looking for KNOWLEDGE, you can get it all for free.  


Let's look into the Foundations of User Experience (UX) Design. If you try to sign up from the main page, you only get the ""7 day try"" option. But in the bottom of the same window, there is also ""**audit**"" the course. It's a free access to videos and lessons. But without the exercise and certification.   


Try if this form of education resonates with you before you choose to pay for it. Consider signing up for the [class central](https://www.classcentral.com/report/category/mooc-news/) newsletter. They often inform about opportunities to get a free certification."

1452,t3_qldkuh,coursera,"So I just got accepted into the program and to get full iMBA college credit you also need to complete a separate portion through canvas. 

Also, you need to create a UIUC coursera account and would potentially lose the work through your other coursera account. 

Now, if you are going the NoPayMBA route, then what you have is an excellent method. If you are trying to reduce your cost but still get the iMBA, I'd consider doing all of the coursera courses as the free part, understand them as best as possible, then apply to the iMBA."

At least this is how I see it."
1465,t3_qfopmd,coursera,Here for answers
1466,t3_qfj3f2,coursera,Describe your situation as in tell them that due to limited financial you won't be able to pay and therefore you will like to the scholarship.

It's been a while since I got mine so my memory is fuzzy but I do recall being able to click a drop down or click a link to view and print the certificate. Sorry this is not very helpful but the support team should be able to help. Congratulations!"
1470,t3_qdposc,coursera,Wait so they canceled Coursera plus?
1471,t3_qdhca7,coursera,"I worked on a part of this at coursera. This has likely changed a lot since 2018 but we had some backend validation to make sure only certain files were permitted and there was no SQL inject attacks. I believe there is a third party service that helps coursera identify which files are malicious and which arent—once the backend gets a green light from that service, the upload is permitted. But yes, upload to any DB generally goes through a series of checks to make sure its not malware"
1472,t3_qcd3t6,coursera,"Contact support and explain the situation.   
This is backend issue that would need to be solved by them."
1473,t3_qcbrxd,coursera,"Yes, you have to request again for each new course in the specialization"

1476,t3_qbenen,coursera,"is this 50% off the premium $39 per month? Also, is it ongoing or just the first month. Sorry I am unfamiliar with this offer."
1477,t3_qb3c0r,coursera,"Which browser are you using? maybe try another browser.   


Do you have any extension installed that may impact the page ?  


If you click on F12 are there any errors displayed in the console ?"
1478,t3_qav4ad,coursera,"Thank you, it's very helpful.

Is it a static database, or how frequently do you update it?"
1479,t3_qapzpv,coursera,"Go to [Coursera Support](https://www.coursera.support/)  
Make sure to login.   
Chat button should appear in the bottom right corner after you login.   
I believe the chat bubble only appears during certain hours, I'm guessing US time zone."
1480,t3_qagkak,coursera,I chose Facebook SMM Coursera what did you decide?
1481,t3_qa8llr,coursera,"On Coursera, a ""purchase"" gives you 6 months access. So even if you paid for it in April, you would have to pay again now."
1482,t3_qa6m1e,coursera,"I’d maybe first by assessing and documenting your current situation/processes.   
How much time is everyone spending on certain tasks? 

  
Example:   
*Staffing:  20%*  
*Stock Management: 50%*  
*Equipment Management: 20%*   
*Store Management: 10%*   
  
Then you can see where you should focus your efforts on and what sort of course would be most relevant for you.   
  
For staff theft have you everything documented?  
What would have prevented them from stealing or enabled you to detect it sooner?  
Everyone makes mistakes but at least try to learn from it quickly."
1483,t3_q9x4lc,coursera,me too
1484,t3_q9kwzv,coursera,"NOT free. 

More like *temporarily* accessible. Access of 180 days for courses, and only 1 month for certificates and specialisations."
1485,t3_q9kdul,coursera,"I'd recommend contacting support with your issue if you have no resolution from the discussion form, highlighting the fact that you need to pass this course as it's considered a college credit.   


Some of the courses have known issues but it's as though the mentors in the discussion form refuse to acknowledge them."

1487,t3_q955je,coursera,"Get COMPTIA certifications. Google's IT cert will only show how you are willing to work for something. HR and many employers (from my observation), actively (and often blindly) just look for popular industry certifications like Cisco or Comptia."

1492,t3_q58s4w,coursera,"The first two courses in Rice University's Fundamentals of Computing specialization (Intro to Interactive Programming in Python I and II) taught me Python in a fun way that gave an excellent foundation for the rest of my studies and work. (It's two classes but I think it used to be one long one.) 

The other four classes in the specialization were also good, but the first pair really nailed down the true fundamentals of programming. Without Coursera, I had no credentials in computing or programming at all. I think they made the difference for me getting into grad school in an informatics program. 

A lot of programming classes or video series focus on delivering information, but don't offer a lot of practice. This one has exercises and projects that give you a chance to actually learn to program. I always say learning to program is like learning to drive, in that classroom hours in driver's ed are helpful and important, but you won't *really* know how to drive until you get those hours on the road. This specialization incorporates plentiful ""road hours."""
1493,t3_q47sfw,coursera,"University looks down on it. But I think it's the future. From my experience, getting coursera certificates - it doesn't help to get you a job. But it gives you the skills that you could use for your own startup/ self employment role"

1499,t3_q388qy,coursera,Crazy world we are living in.

1504,t3_pzxfx2,coursera,"I have found that peer graded anything on Coursera to be riddled with problems. Everything from submitting content to actually getting the assignment graded. I avoid courses that have any peer component. There is no answer for you, Coursera does  not seem to care to (or be able to) fix the peer system."
1505,t3_py6odm,coursera,"I took it - do you have any specific questions? It's an easy course, just watch the videos and pay attention and you'll do just fine on the tests.  Professor Oakley's style is very engaging and fun.  I also took the sort-of sequel course, ""Mindshift"", also on Coursera.  Maybe I ran through them both so quickly, I can't quite differentiate them.  

There are a number of supplemental videos, like interviews with notable learners, polygots.  Some are better than others, but you can skip them without loss of the main ideas of the course."
1506,t3_py7mv6,coursera,"Just graduated but having nothing than having knowledge on technologies that you are interested always a +. You could go without Coursera, it is always an options sometimes better option. Since you will don't care about certificate and go for projects."

1512,t3_puzkuz,coursera,Yes you have to apply for each course
1513,t3_puebf4,coursera,"The only thing I don’t like about peer-graded assignments is that most of the reviews I’ve received lacks substance. There’s no depth to it. I get that most peer reviewers are beginners, but for some seasoned professionals who are taking courses just to refresh their knowledge and gain some new perspective with their respective industries, I don’t think peer-graded assessments are good enough. They're kind of annoying."
1514,t3_ptxzfa,coursera,"Did you write into the discussion form ? 
Did you contact support ?"
1515,t3_pu221m,coursera,Ty for asking and answering.  I too was wondering.
1516,t3_ptg2r9,coursera,"I'm having the same issue as well. I have found a ""fix"". In the desktop version of Safari enable and go to the ""Develop"" menu, then go down to experimental features from there scroll down to ""GPU Process: Media"" and uncheck it. It fixed the issue for me on my MacBook. This fix is also supposed to work on iPad OS and iOS as well but I haven't tested it to see if it works on those platforms."
1517,t3_pt5jmh,coursera,"I have not finnished my subcription courses yet but from what I saw from others is that it depends on the course. If the course's content might change in the future, the course you finnished will be avaliable to access for around 3 months. If not then you will have lifetime access for the course. Hope this helps!"
1518,t3_pt9ht5,coursera,"I think it counts as completed as long as it is the same course.

Also, if you do all courses of a specialization individually, you get the specialization."
1519,t3_psgq80,coursera,"Financial aid is applied per course.

Specializations and (some?) Professional Certificates are a collection of individual courses.

You need to apply for financial aid for each course."
1520,t3_ps5b7y,coursera,"Oh, I also tried 3 different browsers."
1521,t3_ps34s9,coursera,I can't even find the shareable link option
1522,t3_pruo6z,coursera,"You can try and give them that qualification if you don't have a official translated version already, but if they later on ask you to provide one, you'll need to find a reliable source to translate it for you and then sent it to them."
1523,t3_prigep,coursera,"Benefits are the skills/knowledge you gain from taking the actual course. Some employers may favour you over another applicant (assuming you’re similar in all other aspects) if you took training relevant to the job. Benefits regarding universities (assuming you’re wondering about this after taking a look at your profile)? Not much. Accredited universities don’t really recognize these courses, so don’t take these courses expecting these will help with admissions or win scholarships (might help write some parts of scholarship applications though). Take these because you want to, not because it’ll be a boon to your university endeavours."
1524,t3_pqvv6i,coursera,Was just gonna ask the same question here
1525,t3_pqp14j,coursera,"Only pain is to need to individually apply every course on specialization instead of full access first time.

So if, just if, someone from coursera sees this this is my feedback."
1526,t3_pq6rn1,coursera,I think u will get certificate for a single course in a year with coursera for students
1527,t3_ppsei4,coursera,"I am near end of it, it is fine but not ground breaking, it teaches basics of how to deal with situation and people properly and manage your team, contact with your uppers and satisfy stakeholders. You can finish all in a week or so if you have time."
1528,t3_pp64ia,coursera,"Yes you need to apply each individualy, my opinion is it is wrong to do so, because, it is extra time and unnecessary work, but it is Coursera s rule.

 One more thing, financial aid answers come with in 15days so before last two weeks of the course apply, so you dont have to wait."
1529,t3_pofwpb,coursera,"As should be expected, you can't."
1530,t3_po737w,coursera,"I don't believe they have a phone number to call.

If you wanna take the course for the skills, then I will suggest you to go with Udacity because they create more career oriented courses and usually have high quality lectures. 

If you wanna take it for the certificate then of course go ahead with Coursera because the course is authorised and backed by the university. 

It's certainty not that the Coursera course will have worse quality than than the Udacity one, I'm just giving a general opinion. Finally, you'll be better off looking at the reviews AND the syllabus of both the courses. The one which suits you the best is the one you should go with."

Now for the review:

Overall, the platform is great for someone looking to learn a new skill in a broad selection of topics (which you can all view).  


**Pacing: (4/5)**  
Courses / Specializations may or may not have actual deadlines.  
The two types:

  
1. Flexible times  
Some Specializations / Courses allow you to finish it at any time you want. It will say a deadline regardless but this is only so you can finish them at the recommend time. If you ever feel like you forgot about the classes and wish to continue them, you can always press the ""Reset Deadlines"" to get back on track.  
2. Hard deadlines  
Some courses will basically be like an actual college degree with the only difference of you doing it entirely at the comfort of your home. These have Hard deadlines that you cannot reset because these ones are designed ideally for everyone to finish at the same time and graduate together.  


So how do I know which one of the two this Course / Specialization is?  
Go to the main page of whatever class you want to take and it should mention it along with the other general information.

Reason for 4/5 rating:  
The weekly load will ultimately depend on whether you can finish it or not. The system is not perfect but you basically have to adapt to whatever material you must cover in an entire week.  


**Difficulties: (4/5)**  
Courses / Specializations are rated depending on how much knowledge you should have about the topic before you enroll in it.  
1. Beginner

Reason for 4/5 rating:  
I've finished a beginner course before that had a bit of python programming in the end. Man, was the transition rough for that specific course. The course was initially designed to help the student think through computational thinking and algorithms then finally introduce the student to the Python programming language. This is so they can apply their knowledge and use it on a computer interface. It was quite difficult for me because the pacing suddenly changed. I finished the course anyway and do not regret it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Financial Overview: (4/5)**  
You have *2 options* to choose from when enrolling in the courses:  
1. Purchase the course:   
This will save you money if you only wanted to take 1-2 courses in a span of an entire month anyway. Becomes too expensive if you want to take more than 3, just subscribe.  


2.  Subscribing:  
Pay for a fixed monthly fee to view the entire catalogue of courses available to Coursera Plus. This is the best option if you want to learn multiple classes at once and you have set your mindset to completing these.  
**THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE ONES THAT FUNCTION AS A COLLEGE DEGREE / MASTERAL DEGREE ETC.**  


Reason for 4/5 rating:  
I don't really mind the 59 USD per month. However, there are some weird things that happen once in a while in this platform. Recently, they changed the system and the unenroll button was gone. But wait! it's alright don't worry... it only seems to affect Coursera Plus subscribers and the courses I took didn't have hard deadlines to begin with. Again, the platform isn't perfect but it is still useful."
1592,t3_otzd05,coursera,can u enlighten me about the expiration times of these financial aided courses?
1593,t3_otseg5,coursera,"No you won't be able to submit assignments after 6 months (180 days) of getting financial aid.

You may apply fresh financial aid if that expires"
1594,t3_otmrm4,coursera,"Q1, yep once you complete a course you can review it later. I can review the courses I completed last year.  
Q2, Most possibly, I haven't tried. If the course has ""financial aid available"" written on the description you can. But financial aid applications take 15 days to process"
1595,t3_otd83o,coursera,Financial aid means you can enroll in a particular course without having to pay for it or be subscribed to any of Coursera's plans.
1596,t3_oswfvb,coursera,"Well, post earlyer is right, but deliverence is wrong, any course we can suggest can direct you an other path. But this is your path what do you want to learn and be good at. It is up to you my friend. I am also EEE student,was, I take interest in coding more than what my department offer, I took many courses about programming, machine learning and data. And now I am looking for a job related to these, so you should decide on what courses you should pick."
1597,t3_osqk17,coursera,"Same here, I've found it happens on certain courses. Makes no sense"
1598,t3_oslech,coursera,Do machine learning and artificial intelligence courses.
1599,t3_orzwsa,coursera,"Don't worry, providing you put effort in you are 99% chance of getting it"
1600,t3_oruclb,coursera,"Sorry to hijack, similarly I was wondering if you can do all of the free work for courses, then sign up for a month and knock out the paid portions to get certs in less subscription time?"
1601,t3_or272q,coursera,Add the Specialization. Individual certs look like you're all over the place
1602,t3_opt4z3,coursera,"I've not taken the Youth one, but if you are a high school student you can definitely handle the 'adult' one."
1603,t3_opn2kf,coursera,"I hate to bump a thread that is 5 months old, but I have this issue as well. I would like to use anonymous submissions and peer grading because I don't want to risk someone giving me a bad grade in retaliation.

There doesn't seem to be any setting for this in my settings, and there's no mention of it that I can find anywhere in the help documentation."

1606,t3_omm60r,coursera,"[https://www.coursera.org/campus/compare-plans/](https://www.coursera.org/campus/compare-plans/)  


Looks like 1"
1607,t3_olu4m8,coursera,"I've completed one course on Coursera with a peer-review component, and the cheating I encountered was atrocious. Other students would routinely submit:

1. Completely blank assignments. The person submitting the assignment would resubmit it until they were lucky enough to get two graders in a row who passed them for some reason (cheater's camaraderie?).
2. Answers to a completely different assignment, presumably copied from somewhere on the web.  Again, they would just resubmit until they got two passes in a row.
3. First they would submit either 1) or 2) only to subsequently get failed by peer graders. However by this point they have the answer key for peer grading. So then they would just copy and paste from the answer key and resubmit. I saw an actual screenshot of the answer key once.

You can report submissions for plagiarism, which is very straightforward for 3). For 2) it is trickier, as its hard to prove they are plagiarizing if you don't know the source. I tried reporting 1) but it isn't technically against Coursera's rules. So in that case I can only give them a 0 and hope other peer graders do the same.

To be honest I don't think there is a lot of value in Coursera credentials, mostly for this reason. But nevertheless Coursera (in my experience) is a great tool for people who actually want to learn, and that's why I still use it."
1608,t3_olz9qh,coursera,"Strange, what definition are you running the videos in?"
1609,t3_olawvs,coursera,"I assume this happens when you're trying to pay a comparatively high amount, something like the annual Coursera plus subscription. Did you try making smaller transactions?

Just so you know, this happens with people in some countries and India is one of them. This has something to do with the countries' tax and related policies while making large transactions to a foreign body. Not entirely a Coursera problem, but something that's so disadvantageous to people from those countries."
1610,t3_okmxko,coursera,Remind me in 5 days!
1611,t3_okm1zh,coursera,Yeah you'll get a professional certificate.
1612,t3_ok51va,coursera,"No straight answer, some courses are, some courses are to their own uni. Depends what your end goal is"
1613,t3_ohvmvz,coursera,"Search for 'literature' and 'writing' instead of 'English', that might get you better results!"
1614,t3_ohjf3e,coursera,"Yes I experience the same. The problem is with moderators, they are either on a power trip, or they just want the title. There isn't much that can be done apart from report, but then you'll be wasting your own time when it'll happen again. Frustrating."
1615,t3_off2wo,coursera,Do you mean the certificate? It's included in the course price
1616,t3_of1ex1,coursera,"So it appears to be a known issue with no estimated fix. And this was AFTER they tried to convince me it was the cookies on my browser.

*""Thank you for your patience. I truly apologize for the inconvenience it may cause. This is a problem that we already reported to our engineers and that they are aware of and working to solve. Unfortunately, there's no estimated time when this issue could be resolved. In the meantime, we appreciate your patience and understanding while our team finds a permanent solution to this! If our team finds a solution, this would be updated under the course page itself""*"
1617,t3_of2p6l,coursera,"&gt;When I missed a due date can I make the project later or not

Yes, you can. Most courses are self paced. The due dates are just for you to keep some consistency.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;when I choose a free use of a course how can I revert it to an upgraded course????

You can do it at any time you want. You'll have to do it if the purchase is needed in order to get the certificate."
1618,t3_oegbbj,coursera,Have you contected support? What did they say?
1619,t3_oegdua,coursera,This issue does sound frustrating. Our dev team has reached out to you for more details via DM.  We will address this as quickly as possible.
1620,t3_odi8vw,coursera,"I am not %100 sure but, the deadline for financial aid is i think 6 months. After that if you not complete the course it terminates your aid."
1621,t3_odd4xn,coursera,"Good question - the prices are per month per course. In all honesty, have a look at the plus subscription (I'm on plus). Sometimes coursera do special offers so have a look around from time to time  


Coursera have an IOS app you can use, or you can use via the web. I find the web slightly better."
1622,t3_obmxew,coursera,Trojan found in your link. EVERYONE: be super careful!!!
1623,t3_oateyn,coursera,Just completed these today. Hoping to at least get an entry level help desk job and work on the trifecta certs and work my way up
1624,t3_oan6er,coursera,Yes
1625,t3_oa7eea,coursera,"You can take basic math courses: calculus and linear algebra.There are engineering mechanics courses offered by Georgia Tech, University of Michigan offers an Introduction to Thermodynamics . These courses are usually taught in first and second year of Mechanical Engineering.

If you are into robotics you can take the IOT specialization, the Robotics specialization by Upenn, or the modern robotics specialization by the Northwestern University. But these courses require you to be adept in programming.

You can also take CAD courses.  


You can also learn programming, like MATLAB or Python.

Finally, mechanical engineering is a very broad engineering field, learn anything related to STEM, and it is gonna come in handy.

But I am not sure if these courses are gonna help you with college admission, if that is your goal here."
1626,t3_o9y0dh,coursera,"In general Coursera is very buggy as a platform, for me personally I only bought it for the quality of the content, I've had numerous issues on the platform. Maybe reaching out to them on social media might get you a better result but from the support perspective I found it pretty poor."
1627,t3_o8xss9,coursera,"Financial aid is applied before starting the course...well,still.apply for it"
1628,t3_o7s65v,coursera,"It's good that you are documenting this here.

There are many issues with many companies resulting from WFH policies.  I know for sure that one HUGE organization that is tax-supported has been home for over a year and many things slip through the cracks..

Just keep trying."
1629,t3_o7jpef,coursera,Is reading a book worth it??
1630,t3_o698bk,coursera,"I work in the tech field (UK), I run multiple businesses. Each vacancy posted usually attracts &gt;120 applications. With covid, we are seeing around 800 applicants. I spend no more than 20 seconds looking at cv's. I employ over 120 staff.  


If your mindset if one of completing a course and you expect to be hired, then that needs to change quickly.  


It's tough out there at the moment."

1636,t3_o4p6a3,coursera,"yeah, a dark theme would be nice."
1637,t3_o4px8m,coursera,"Good question - drop coursera an email, I've done a few specialisations where the uni has used the same course in them, and it hasn't been shown I've done it, so I simply re-do the exam again"

1639,t3_o3k9ke,coursera,"They're not recognized by employers and a joke. They're just good to see if yoy want to pursue IT. Look into geting the comp a+ cert first for IT.

1642,t3_o237lo,coursera,"Did you check the discussions ? Are other people
facing the issue ?"
1643,t3_o1vl3c,coursera,I believe you get to review after completing the course
1644,t3_o17lry,coursera,"If you notice, the spike takes place in the early 2020. At the beginning of the pandemic, coursera offered 3 months of free courses for students, this boosted coursera's user base. I started using coursera then.


Also coursera is more generous with financial aid, attracting a huge amount of users in this way."
1645,t3_o0zlrl,coursera,"Instead of spamming the group you should be doing your own research, looking at your previous posts you are wanting others to answer your questions. Use a bit of common sense and use a search engine.

1650,t3_nz3oqa,coursera,"From my experience, I’m pretty sure that the deadlines don’t have any effect on you completing a course. I feel that they are set for you to complete the course within their recommended period of time"
1651,t3_nydd0b,coursera,We have no idea what you're on about
1652,t3_nvdryj,coursera,I've never had a single issue since signing up years ago. What is your system?
1653,t3_nuzk1k,coursera,"The financial aid is for a single course - not a group. Every course will require a financial aid application.  


In terms of the course, you can theoretically take ten years. However, each week usually takes 4-5 hours, so you could finish the course in two weeks if you put your mind to it."
1654,t3_nv0amf,coursera,I have the same problem
1655,t3_nuaog5,coursera,"Last two weeks of specialization, I am very glad that i took the course and study the teachings. I highly suggest anyone who is interested in ML/DL. Course is very basic and assigment are very well defined and not very hard. You can finish this course with empty hands or you study,   take the knowledge and leave the course with real solid understanding of DL"
1656,t3_nsrj0r,coursera,"I had a similar problem, if you search missed deadlines coursera, coursera help page states you can refresh deadlines. There is no specific thing saying if you are financial aid, this doesn't count, so it should work. I have finals right now so i left the deadline after university"
1657,t3_nsmeik,coursera,You will have access for the 7 days. Not after that.

1660,t3_nqx7nm,coursera,"Afaik you can't sit for quiz or submit assignments when you are auditing. You can only watch the tutorials.
To obtain certificate you need to submit the assignments. 

And answer to your question is you wouldn't need to pay for them separately."
1661,t3_no7fsq,coursera,"Have you rebooted your router, and have you cleared your browser cache?"
1662,t3_nn2jwn,coursera,"Andrew NG machine learning is free you can do that
And I don't think there's a complete data science course
Most things I have seen are specializations so basically you have to get more than one course"
1663,t3_nms3qk,coursera,"Treat it as though it were a regular class. Devote the same amount of energy and attention to it. Remember you can watch the videos multiple times unlike in class lectures. So, watch the video once fully through without stopping like a regular lecture then go back and take notes while pausing then go back once more on difficult topics. Read the additional materials they suggest or provide. Don't be afraid to Google what you don't know. You wouldn't depend just on in class lectures so don't depend on just the videos."

1667,t3_njw64o,coursera,I'd have thought it'd be cheaper to grab the yearly subscription in the first week of January @ 20% off. The specialisations are usually excellent and pushes the student
1668,t3_nk0ub7,coursera,"I did not take the course but on the webpage of the first course (Exploratory Data Analysis for Machine Learning)  it clearly states:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;What skills should you have?

1674,t3_nijsc5,coursera,"Have you looked under ""in progress"" or ""saved"" the course wouldn't have disappeared.  


Search for the course again and see what the status shows"
1675,t3_nhpvex,coursera,"You really have answered your own question there?

Remember - their name will be on the certificate at the end of it, not yours"
1676,t3_nhv879,coursera,Have you looked at [classcentral.com](https://classcentral.com)?
1677,t3_nhpubs,coursera,"""so"", the financial aid is per course until you finish, or unenroll on that course. Keep going at it.  


Financial aid is relatively easy to gain - providing you are honest. It's machine read and reviewed by a person."
1678,t3_nhms66,coursera,"I suppose you can use the same essay for all the courses (at least in some specializations), if your reasoning applies equally to all of them. I did that and got approved."
1679,t3_nh3l4x,coursera,"No downfall at all. I only complete specialisations and missed a few.  


If you have a capstone final, you will need to wait for the next group of students to review your work, that may take up to three months.  


What courses are you doing?"
1680,t3_ngy3mb,coursera,"for anyone interested, I did enroll in the class again and my progress was kept."
1681,t3_ngfykg,coursera,Me too. A couple weeks ago someone told me it was a known issue and they had devs working on it but I’ve seen people on the forums complaining about this for years. I asked if they could manually verify my identity and they said no since they use a third party program for verification. If you find anything out please let me know.
1682,t3_nev01r,coursera,Have you created a portfolio of your work ?
1683,t3_ndmlw5,coursera,I'm just browsing the entries that haven't been replied - did you manage it? Can you log in via the web? What devices are you using?
1684,t3_nd43bg,coursera,"I don’t know how the interface of Coursera in English is, because I have it in Spanish. But you click on a course, and at the top it must say something like “Start today for free”, click it and you will have to choose between doing the Course for free but without certificate, or the option of buying the course so you get the certificate. 

Be aware that Coursera have available courses, specialized courses, masters, group projects and degrees. So the cost of the things should be different in every one."
1685,t3_naqqd0,coursera,"I can say at least the degrees I've looked at are certainly accredited and are the exact same as if you attended on-campus.

Some of their masters are interesting to me. Their graduate degrees are coming from upper-tier schools like UIUC (top 5 in multiple programs), U Penn (Ivy League), HEC Paris (#2 business school in Europe), etc., so 

If I understand correctly, they have 3 bachelor degrees available, two being from the University of London.

I understand it to be a very good school, but obviously it will be a different accreditation than American schools. That said, because it's a reputable school and accreditation, I don't think that'll matter all that much, though it will probably raise some curiosity questions from employers... or are you looking at the North Texas option?"
1686,t3_napkdw,coursera,"Statistics with R is very good and in depth for a beginner‘s course with good resources, I‘d recommend this one."

1689,t3_naa36j,coursera,"No and yes(!)  


Can you get aid for a yearly membership? No, but per course - yes  


You can achieve financial aid on each individual course and each course including specializations."
1690,t3_n9vhsv,coursera,Totally agreed with you there. Have the same feelings about pre-requisites for courses. There needs to be a section in the course info indicating what you should know before you start/buy the course.
1691,t3_n9a2z0,coursera,"yes, you can apply for the next while doing the previous"
1692,t3_n9bxe8,coursera,"Rutgers - yes  


Felt like a slap in the face with a frozen fish. Good luck buddy :)"
1693,t3_n929ji,coursera,Yes it just seems like the instructors have abandoned most courses lol. If you’re lucky you get a smart student who knows the answer or there was another student 3 years ago who had exactly your problem and some instructor answered to them.
1694,t3_n956i4,coursera,I think 'down for maintenance'  shows up whenever there is an unrecoverable error on the page. Do you see any errors when open up the devtools? (right click -&gt; inspect -&gt; console)
1695,t3_n88cgh,coursera,"If you finished the course, your PDF should generate automatically."
1696,t3_n6s5kt,coursera,"I didn't try this course in particular, but I find that the company-generated courses in general, for IBM and Microsoft and Google, are disappointing and often not as rigorous as the university courses.

Has anyone had a similar experience?"
1697,t3_n62tfp,coursera,"I had a similar dilemma. I choose Google (or University that crated course). Coursera recommends putting their name there, since it's a good branding opportunity.  As far as I'm concerned the Coursera is a provider. It handles technology, organization, and administration. But the quality of the course itself is determined by a partner who's responsible for content.   


And the link to the certificate is there, right? If someone wants to know the details it's all available."
1698,t3_n5rhwa,coursera,"https://valenciacollege.edu/admissions/admissions-records/documents/AlternativeMethodsofEarningCreditLocalAgreementsandStateArticulation.pdf

i don't think so"
1699,t3_n5femm,coursera,"AFAIK, the regular Coursera courses and Specializations are not accredited at all, although a lot of content is offered by accredited schools. There are new degree programs being promoted, so those might be different."
1700,t3_n4t2ob,coursera,looking forward to these in-depth course reviews
1701,t3_n4i91w,coursera,"You would still have access to the course, except for the graded parts, so just like an auditor. Also, you get a trial period for each of the new courses."
1702,t3_n44g8w,coursera,Specializations are a la carte monthly for the entire set. Courses are one time and 180 days to complete. There is coursera+ which allows certifications for most courses where you pay monthly until canceled. Unless I’m missing something here?
1703,t3_n40m74,coursera,"I'm currently taking the [Introduction to Classical Music](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introclassicalmusic/home/welcome) course and it's been fantastic so far. The instructor is very engaging and I enjoy the content. Once that's done, I'm thinking about taking [Archaeoastronomy](https://www.coursera.org/learn/archaeoastronomy)."
1704,t3_n3iuzl,coursera,"you are encouraged to research, i.e. google the answers to the questions!

i know the websites with the flash cards, i think they are specifically designed for people who take the course to come to their website.

you’re definitely not going to get thrown out by coursera for it, as it’s possible to just guess the answers until everything is correct, too, but one could argue that it would be dishonest to use these specially tailored websites to get answers, while you do not know WHY the answer is correct. so when doing research on a quiz, you can use these flash cards, as long as you know why the answer is correct -&gt; you learned something on your own by researching."
1705,t3_n3dezz,coursera,"There's a lot of bugs with the iOS application, it's not just you. Personally I just use the website."
1706,t3_n1s7lr,coursera,"Trust me, employers don't care about your solutions to Coursera assignments !  
If any employer does find out that you are sharing assignment solutions publicly, they might also take it against you. It'll make them worry that one day you might even post the confidential code of the company publicly to showcase your work to the ""future employer"".  
If, however, you do want to save this code for reference purpose, upload it to Github and mark the repository as private. It'll atleast show up as a contribution in your Github activity chart."
1707,t3_n1molm,coursera,"AFAIK if you apply thru financial aid, you need to apply for each course separately (also for the final project)"
1708,t3_n17uwz,coursera,"Afaik, the peer review can also be completed after the assignment deadline is over. you just can’t resubmit a new one if the current one does not pass."
1709,t3_n17rdi,coursera,All 8 ...
1710,t3_n113km,coursera,"Most of them are not but some courses give you college credits, you just have to read the description of the course and see if it says anything about it. For example, Google IT Support Professional Certificate does give you college credits.

1725,t3_muc1hl,coursera,"First courses and Coursera Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate is VERY introductory: The difference between the qualitative and quantitative type of lessons. I'm not sure if you're not above this level already. It's literally from zero to hero, and I think you may be disappointed in lessons about the sum function in a spreadsheet. The end courses are about using R, but it'll take a while to get there. You'd probably need a more steep learning curve.   


Also, ""R"" is kind of a disappointment for me since I was hoping for python - for the existing market, or Julia - for the future market (man, Julia is awesome)  


What kind of the first job are you hoping to land? For example, there are a lot of  ways to learn(for free) about tools for analyzing online traffic. It can be a back-door entry to some analyst role."

-I would switch between multiple but as I am paying for Coursrea right now I am prioritizing my time with that

-I would switch if there was a platform that had courses that were not offered on coursera that I would find beneficial to my career or if they just happened to peak my curiosity

-I use online learning to further my skill set and to attain some level of recognition of the time I put into bettering myself

-I am a HS graduate, honors recipient, technical designation and Cisco CCNA certified by 17. But my family could not support me into college, and I did not have the opportunity to devote that time.

Or they’ll make Coursera Plus extremely limited and make something with the full features called Coursera Platinum or something. I am usually an optimistic person, but I don’t see this going extremely well for the customers."
