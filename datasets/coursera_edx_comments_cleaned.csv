For the most parts of the world such as western europe, north and south america. Central america and pacific region. Russia, east and south Asia like India, it is accepted by many people. 

I know they accepte these certificates because I google the ""successful stories"" of how people who got edx certificate get a job.

You have indian who got a job in microsoft in India for it.
You have some people who start work for google because of their certificate.
You also could see many other successful stories.

However, there is one place that you can not get recognition for your certificate. This place is China, I have not yet see any successful record conduct by edx learners.

167,t3_mvkxmb,edx,"In my opinion having a certificate from popular university is a good tool for marketing yourself for a job interview with your resume.

I included 4-5 edx math and algorithms certificates when I applied to a software engineering job and I got hired. 3-4 months into the job I asked my interviewer whether these certificates gave him good signal about me, and indeed he told me that when he saw them, he assumed that my intelligence was above the mean.

So to summarize - was it worth it? It depends. Would have I gotten the job without the certs? Probably yes. Does it increase the probability to land an interview in general? In my opinion yes. Besides the career bonus that you get from the certificates to market yourself, I do not see a reason to pay for the courses, since they are free.

The content of the courses is pretty good and they do teach you some very useful tools. But to be honest, these last parts do feel abandoned by staff. For example, I just checked the discussion forums which are used to answer questions. For the 5th course the staff hasn't responded in couple of months as far as I can tell. The last response for the capstone was about a month ago (about the bot being fixed), but that forum isn't used as much as the one for course 5.

I usually set a time limit before looking up a tutorial so I don't get frustrated and quit. Example, if I start a problem Tuesday and I've struggled with it until Thursday, on Friday I will watch a tutorial. It's very gratifying solving problems after being stuck, but I have no shame in looking for help if I feel I've put in my best effort.

306,t3_i2ylzr,edx,"I think I've seen people discussing the supply chain micromasters so you might be able to find their conversations.

On edx... by itself having this isn't going to advance your career. What will do that is you learning new things that can relate to your job or future position. If you feel that these courses will give you some knowledge that you can apply then maybe it will help you. But just like all education, whether official or not, or on personal time or school time or work time, it's all about what you make of it. Taking these courses so you can show the certificate and then voila now you are qualified isn't really a thing in my opinion.  Having said all this, I've taken 15-20 classes and chose to do the certificate on all but 1 or 2 because it helps me to finish if I've got skin in the game and I also like having access to the questions to assess myself on whether I'm comprehending it or not. My company paid for some and I chose to pay for the others. 

On the timing, I find that of the many I've taken, I'm usually on the short side of the timing window. So if it says 8 weeks at 2-6 hours per week, I'd guess that I should finish in between 16-48 hours total and if I timed myself on this fictional scenario I'd probably finish in 20 hours. So take the timing with a grain of salt. If it's a totally new subject maybe it takes a bit longer and if it's fine tuning something you already work with then maybe you blast through it much faster.

What is a MicroMasters Program?
MicroMasters programs are a series of graduate level courses from top universities designed to advance your career. MicroMasters program certificates showcase deep learning and in-demand skills to employers and can help you get started on a path toward completing an advanced degree.

How to Earn a MicroMasters Program Certificate
To earn the program certificate, learners must complete and successfully earn a verified certificate in all four MicroMasters program courses, as well as the capstone project.

From Program Certificate to a Master’s Degree
MicroMasters programs are designed to offer learners a pathway to an advanced degree and can count as credit toward completing a Master’s degree program. Learners who successfully earn this MicroMasters program certificate may apply for admission to a Master’s program, and if accepted, the MicroMasters program certificate will count towards the degree.

Learners who successfully earn the MicroMasters program certificate may apply to the Master of Science program Sustainable Energy Technology (SET) or the Master of Science program Electrical Engineering (track: Electrical Power Engineering) at TU Delft. You will need to go through the regular admission procedures for MSc students and meet the entry requirements for those MSc programs. If you are admitted and you would like to be exempted from courses in the aforementioned MSc programs, you are required to send a formal waiver request. Campus courses that can be waived (up to 16-18 credits) are courses that are equivalent to the solar energy courses of the MSc program in question:

MSc Sustainable Energy Technology
MSc Electrical Engineering (Electrical Power Engineering track)

(That's just one person's experience.) Most courses should tell you very clearly whether the quizzes &amp; exams are open book. For the courses I took, **I freely refer to my course notes, lecture videos, and my own answers to prior quizzes &amp; homeworks.** 

Open book means open book. If lecture 2 says ""here is the formula for net present value"" then you are allowed to look at that formula up anywhere you want (not only in the notes).

I doubt that using a fill-in-the-blanks financial calculator would be cheating for ***most*** courses, ***if*** it is open book. You probably get more learning from working a formula yourself one time on your own, though, or by playing around with calculator inputs and seeing how the output changes (e.g. in a compound interest situation, would you rather double the interest rate, double the period of investment, or double the initial investment?).

Does it transfer to other universities?  It's at the discretion of the specific university.  Some will, but honestly and maybe controversially I think that most won't.  People seem to be skeptical of online programs and I bet many unis would rather charge full price and milk people for money.

Edit:  I'm doing courses and a program from Wharton UPenn, and am doing a course from Harvard which nicely compliments the courses from Wharton (ties it all together well), but my Harvard class is not officially linked to my Wharton ones.  

However, I noticed the end deadlines for final course completion was suddenly pushed back by several months (earlier this week the deadlines for all of the courses was late May to early June.  But woke up one morning and now it's December 2020?  After I've been busting my butt for 6 weeks for 8-10 hours / day to meet the end-of-May deadline).  

I don't get it.   And the assignment dates (each module assignment date) has now disappeared suddenly.

I'm wondering, because courses are cyclical, and because so many start in January and are up for 5-6 months, if the near-end period makes it so we just happened to be in the stream as the course cycles reset, pushing things back. 

Regardless, considering how finicky the online platform can sometimes be, I'm not leaving anything to chance, and am still going to continue working my butt off to complete all assignments and final projects by the original dates posted before they expire (the pre-push back dates). 

The last thing I want if to slow down now, work past those original dates (yet conform to the new dates) and have the system tell me I failed because I didn't meet the deadlines owing to having enrolled under the framework of an earlier course cycle.  I wouldn't leave anything to chance.

395,t3_gfypa2,edx,"To be clear a MicroMasters Certificate is not a Masters Degree.  Well, not a full one at least. The one you're considering is 1/3 of the Masters.  

Can I ask, where are you from?  You used the word CV instead of Resume.  Are you British?

The reason I ask is because here in the UK we have what is called a Postgraduate Certificate.  This Micromasters is essentially the same thing IMO.  A university certificate made up of postgraduate courses equaling 1/3 of the masters.

That makes it simple for me to explain my MicroMasters to any employer or contact who asks, because a PGCert is quite well known here (every single teacher requires one for example).

Is having a MicroMasters valuable?  Yeah, definitely!  Becoming more qualified generally improves one's opportunities and potential earnings.

Completing such study also shows an interest in the subject area, determination, ambition, and gives some evidence of skills such as planning and good time management etc.

Of course you'll surely gain some knowledge and skills in Cloud Computing too.  Also the opportunity to put it towards the full masters if you ever choose.

People sometimes say ""MOOCs are useless!"", well I disagree for the above reasons but also in the real world I've only ever had positive responses towards my extra studies, and my MicroMasters helped me get a great job with a top company.

The Micromasters is also very, very affordable relatively speaking.  Plus there is financial aid if you need it.

So in conclusion, I can't talk for the specifics of that program, but I think MicroMasters in general are great.

You should look into alternatives though and weigh them all up.  There are Google Cloud, AWS, Azure certs etc.  Perhaps one is better than the other.  Or perhaps the Micromasters would compliment one of those very well.  I dunno.

It may depend on the specific MicroMasters, but when I did mine... each class ran from a set date to a set date for the duration of the class.  Start of January to end of February for 8 weeks for example.

For example, with the exception of the capstone exam course I could have done the week 3 test in week 3 when it opened, or I could have left it to the last minute, but the class has a distinct end date.

You don't have to do every class at the same time.  You can do it slower if you'd like, one by one for example.  That may be necessary if you are busy and have other commitments.

1. Take one class at a time if you work full time or don't have 30 hours a week to dedicate to the classes. They are rigorous, and it is easy to fall behind.
2. Suggested order: Probability, Statistics, Data Analysis in Social Science, ML in Python - this is not the order I did it in but it would have been a much better choice
3. To earn the certificate in the specific classes, you only need 60% - for me, just the certificate matters and not the actual grade - I make sure I attain a 60% before the final exam and skip the final. The course content is available for up to a year after the class has finished and it is possible use the final exam answers to study later for the capstone :)

There are many courses covering a large range of topics. Some are part of specializations/programs, which are collections of courses with a common theme (and sometimes increasing in difficultly). 

Courses are free to audit, but you pay for certificates - and sometimes some of the content. (You can apply for financial assistance if you cannot afford the course.) Personally, I audit most courses, but I recently paid for a programming course, because I thought it would be useful for a job application.

If you are looking for courses that count towards your degree, you will have to take that up with your university/department. I'd say picking some semi-random courses and hoping for the best is not going to be worth it.

There is nothing preventing you from adding coursework to your resume. I have a section of my resume under “education” labeled “other coursework” Which contains any relevant on my courses. I imagine that it would be weighed or considered similarly to a single non-credit course; that is to say, it’s very unlikely that a single online course is going to make a difference in your job hunt. It does tend to demonstrate that you are an autodidact, and all employers want someone who can grow and learn.
&gt;	Further to this, are these courses good? 

Some yes, some less so. There’s a lot of variance in quality, so asking this question is roughly similar to asking “how good is a chemistry course” without specifying which course it is, which university of that, which professor is teaching it, etc. however, the opportunity cost of trying of course is pretty low. It’s free, and within 20 or 30 minutes you should start to get a feel as to the quality of the course.

If I had to pay for these courses, I would simply have had no way to make it happens. And the truth is, even when I wasn t motivated to work and learn, the gradded approach kept me going through the good and bad.

Thanks to this, I m a better man today than I would have ever been with traditionnal courses/learning methods, it gave me back the curiosity I lost on my way to life. 

You especially talked about this in your ted talk, how to communicate passion and curiosity, to your own daughter. You were one of my favorite ted talks with Tim Urban.

It was understandable in 2015 to change the model to only offer verification certificate to the paying students and not giving it anymore without proper verification.

But today, you are ready to close the doors on what made this plaform stands out, giving education and knowledge to the left-outs, to the peoples whose could not attend,  nor have the money or opportunities to get better acces to knowledge and education. IMO grading is an imperative part of the process of learning and this new formula is just an empty shell, binding people to pay. 

But clearly the demographic targets: whose can pay more than 500$ US on a course (not a degree), don t really need edx, they can follow and pay any standard cursus. The ones whose will be left out, are the ones who already have very few choices in terms of educations, with poor acces to quality material and infrastructure, or simply stuck in minimum wage work to sustain the day to day. 

I believe, if that change pass, this would be a failure for our model of society, this would indeed mean we could not find a way to sustain free quality education platform, while we have no problem finding funds for wars, social media and of course, personnal greed...

The worst part, in my opinion, is that the marginal cost to grade non paying students is close to 0 compared to the cost of the platform. (more electricity? more calculating power?)

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if this choice is motivated by rentability or sustainability, but I do hope you find an alternative, else this would be a sad day

If we set the money aspect aside...  The question really is, why not?  Sure, if there are other things that you feel you could be doing that would look better on a college application, you may want to try to figure out which is more important, but at the end of the day, once you finish the course (verified cert. or not), you'll have learned something that will help you in your college career.  I'd say that's better than not having it at all.

By your username I'm going to assume that you are Brazilian (even though you could be Portuguese or other).


Here in São Paulo I've had some luck with the Supply Chain certificates from MIT (not Micromaster yet). It's certainly a big differential between me and other candidates, aside from my university.


When I go to group dynamics and exercises, HR or the company handling the hiring process doesn't care about my certifications, asking one or two questions about it, but when present, the managers hiring always seem intrigued by the specific knowledge I have acquired (more than the certificates). That and the fact that the courses are in English, which implies full fluency in the language.


I can't say for sure, but I think that I've been treated differently from other candidates twice, mainly due to my university, but I think that the Micromasters also had something to do with it.


In one case, I was called by the hiring company's HR and told to come for an interview directly with the manager interested in me, without having participated in any group exercises and evaluation prior (a standard procedure here).


The other case, the manager was present at the group exercise, along with the people from the HR company that was handling the hiring process. He asked me a lot of questions and seemed to have taken an interest in me. Later, the HR company told me that I was one of the candidates they were interested in interviewing, and should be getting a call to set up the date with the manager, but it never came.


Instead, I got a call form the Hiring company's HR, and was told that they needed a few documents from my university to put in my employment contract. I hope to get and sign it next week.

704,t3_59831n,edx,"Well HarleySport1200, learning is never a waste of time and I would encourage you to take advantage of all of the FREE learning that is available via edX.  Depending on your employer would answer the question on whether or not the certificate is valid.  Many companies in my experience are looking for individuals that can perform the task hired for and not so much the certifications.  If you have certifications, however, that show you have the knowledge and skills to perform those task, then your certification verified via edX would be beneficial.  I've ventured down this road already and have found that many online certification don't mean much to employers.  This is largely in part due to employers not finding online learning websites as a viable institution for learning.  I firmly believe it all depends on you and what you feel is necessary.

705,t3_593pbs,edx,"Interesting. I took the first class, passed verified at around 85%, and got the certificate. The 10 week course took a lot out of me though; studying took way too much time in addition to my full-time job. I opted out and stopped taking any more classes. I will say that the first class was interesting, I learned a lot, and after finishing, I wished that I had more time to complete the 5-class series. The TAs were as helpful as I had expected them to be. I usually don't utilize TAs though, even when I was at a real university I didn't. My mentality was that the course was pre-designed and pre-created to be mostly hands-off. I didn't expect the TAs and professors to cater to 30k people when my real professors and TAs in college could only handle a couple hundred.

&gt;I feel I have wasted a great deal of time &amp; effort on a program that is becoming more impossible to complete with every course. Not to mention has NO real-world value: I applied for an entry level internship in supply chain and was told that the MicroMasters credential held no value whatsoever.

I pretty much wasted my time and effort too. But that's because I only took one class. I did benefit from ""re-booting"" my brain though; ever since I took the course I have been able to get into the mindset of studying other material. That's what happens when you graduate college and stop studying for five years, your brain forgets how to learn. If anything, I feel like anyone studying for a MicroMaster should focus on the education and learning aspect, not the financial benefit. Because as of now, the MicroMasters credential holds no value because literally nobody has attained it. The value hasn't been proven yet. I'm not surprised to hear that employers don't value it. The purpose of the MicroMasters is to learn about supply chain and have a minuscule chance of getting into the actual MIT program. If you expected for employers to see the value of the Micromasters when literally nobody has attained it yet, I can see why you are disappointed. At this point, anybody trying to get the MicroMaster is essential an early adopter. And as with any other product, early adopters run the risk of buying into a shoddy product (as well as the opposite, being the first to adopt a great product)",2276,406,interesting i took the first class passed verified at around 85 and got the certificate the 10 week course took a lot out of me though studying took way too much time in addition to my full time job i opted out and stopped taking any more class i will say that the first class wa interesting i learned a lot and after finishing i wished that i had more time to complete the 5 class series the ta were a helpful a i had expected them to be i usually don t utilize ta though even when i wa at a real university i didn t my mentality wa that the course wa pre designed and pre created to be mostly hand off i didn t expect the ta and professor to cater to 30k people when my real professor and ta in college could only handle a couple hundred gt i feel i have wasted a great deal of time amp effort on a program that is becoming more impossible to complete with every course not to mention ha no real world value i applied for an entry level internship in supply chain and wa told that the micromasters credential held no value whatsoever i pretty much wasted my time and effort too but that s because i only took one class i did benefit from re booting my brain though ever since i took the course i have been able to get into the mindset of studying other material that s what happens when you graduate college and stop studying for five year your brain forgets how to learn if anything i feel like anyone studying for a micromaster should focus on the education and learning aspect not the financial benefit because a of now the micromasters credential hold no value because literally nobody ha attained it the value hasn t been proven yet i m not surprised to hear that employer don t value it the purpose of the micromasters is to learn about supply chain and have a minuscule chance of getting into the actual mit program if you expected for employer to see the value of the micromasters when literally nobody ha attained it yet i can see why you are disappointed at this point anybody trying to get the micromaster is essential an early adopter and a with any other product early adopter run the risk of buying into a shoddy product a well a the opposite being the first to adopt a great product,interest i took the first class pass verifi at around 85 and got the certif the 10 week cours took a lot out of me though studi took way too much time in addit to my full time job i opt out and stop take ani more class i will say that the first class wa interest i learn a lot and after finish i wish that i had more time to complet the 5 class seri the ta were as help as i had expect them to be i usual don t util ta though even when i wa at a real univers i didn t my mental wa that the cours wa pre design and pre creat to be mostli hand off i didn t expect the ta and professor to cater to 30k peopl when my real professor and ta in colleg could onli handl a coupl hundr gt i feel i have wast a great deal of time amp effort on a program that is becom more imposs to complet with everi cours not to mention ha no real world valu i appli for an entri level internship in suppli chain and wa told that the micromast credenti held no valu whatsoev i pretti much wast my time and effort too but that s becaus i onli took one class i did benefit from re boot my brain though ever sinc i took the cours i have been abl to get into the mindset of studi other materi that s what happen when you graduat colleg and stop studi for five year your brain forget how to learn if anyth i feel like anyon studi for a micromast should focu on the educ and learn aspect not the financi benefit becaus as of now the micromast credenti hold no valu becaus liter nobodi ha attain it the valu hasn t been proven yet i m not surpris to hear that employ don t valu it the purpos of the micromast is to learn about suppli chain and have a minuscul chanc of get into the actual mit program if you expect for employ to see the valu of the micromast when liter nobodi ha attain it yet i can see whi you are disappoint at thi point anybodi tri to get the micromast is essenti an earli adopt and as with ani other product earli adopt run the risk of buy into a shoddi product as well as the opposit be the first to adopt a great product

721,t3_4t14wk,edx,"Well I've paid for many classes on edx and coursera. I can honestly say no one cares about these certs. I have around 36 and I'm a mentor for the iOS Swift course.  I was highly disappointed in some of the classes I paid for and vowed to never pay for another one.  However I actually learn things in these classes and I enjoy them.

I take the stats, linear algebra , machine learning, r type classes and I assure you I'll never get a job I'm those fields. Not thru lack of ability but simply I'm labeled an old man who only knows embedded programming.  

With that said I still take them and my favorite is the coursera iOS objective c series.  

Fwiw I had a recruiter contact me based upon a LinkedIn profile for a machine learning job.  I sent him a resume and he replied I'm looking for a data scientist not a software developer.  I laughed cause what else could I do?

I had another respond for an iot job where he asked if I had any iot experience when I've ported Linux to a network process soc, worked with Bluetooth components via UART on a board running on baremetal and no OS, and have even done aws work.  Not to mention started out with Linux prior to 1.0 kernels and have done drivers and user land apps in Linux.  I was like damn dude there were internet connected devices long before iot became a word.

So if you enjoy learning take all the classes you enjoy but don't take them to get a job.  I just don't think a hr person will consider them relevant.  I even had a smug younger developer make a remark about any thing you have done five years ago is irrelevant.  Mind you I've taken univ level classes at undergrad and grad level on campus simply to keep my skills up and because I enjoy learning new things.  I even poke around and read because it interests me.

Last I checked, everything is still in Python 2. I took 6.00.1x this past summer and I did a little research since this question came up in the course's forum. Here is my response to the original question ""why 2.7 and not 3.4?"":

They are most likely still using Python 2 for legacy reasons. I did a little digging with Google and came up with a plausible answer. It appears that although the course was first offered on the edX platform in 2012, the curriculum for the edX version is most likely based on the 600 course on the OCW website offered to MIT students in Fall 2008. Python 3 was released towards the end of that semester, in December 2008. So one reason is that the original curriculum was designed before Python 3 was even released.

That being said, I don't think they've stuck with Python 2 out of shear laziness. The primary goal of this course is to teach computer science (e.g logic and flow control, basic data structures, simple algorithms) which doesn't really require any particular programming language.

Even though there are a couple things about Python 3 that really make more sense (most noticeable to me is the print() function and how division is treated), it's probably isn't enough to justify rewriting everything to work with Python 3.",1268,222,last i checked everything is still in python 2 i took 6 00 1x this past summer and i did a little research since this question came up in the course s forum here is my response to the original question why 2 7 and not 3 4 they are most likely still using python 2 for legacy reason i did a little digging with google and came up with a plausible answer it appears that although the course wa first offered on the edx platform in 2012 the curriculum for the edx version is most likely based on the 600 course on the ocw website offered to mit student in fall 2008 python 3 wa released towards the end of that semester in december 2008 so one reason is that the original curriculum wa designed before python 3 wa even released that being said i don t think they ve stuck with python 2 out of shear laziness the primary goal of this course is to teach computer science e g logic and flow control basic data structure simple algorithm which doesn t really require any particular programming language even though there are a couple thing about python 3 that really make more sense most noticeable to me is the print function and how division is treated it s probably isn t enough to justify rewriting everything to work with python 3,last i check everyth is still in python 2 i took 6 00 1x thi past summer and i did a littl research sinc thi question came up in the cours s forum here is my respons to the origin question whi 2 7 and not 3 4 they are most like still use python 2 for legaci reason i did a littl dig with googl and came up with a plausibl answer it appear that although the cours wa first offer on the edx platform in 2012 the curriculum for the edx version is most like base on the 600 cours on the ocw websit offer to mit student in fall 2008 python 3 wa releas toward the end of that semest in decemb 2008 so one reason is that the origin curriculum wa design befor python 3 wa even releas that be said i don t think they ve stuck with python 2 out of shear lazi the primari goal of thi cours is to teach comput scienc e g logic and flow control basic data structur simpl algorithm which doesn t realli requir ani particular program languag even though there are a coupl thing about python 3 that realli make more sens most notic to me is the print function and how divis is treat it s probabl isn t enough to justifi rewrit everyth to work with python 3

I don't mind not getting the certification as I don't think it is worth much in the industry. In my opinion, the only certifications that have value are those from vendors like Oracle, AWS, Databricks, Google, Microsoft, ...

  
Another reason that I think devalues Coursera certificates is that I now know how to work around the system. Whenever you want to complete a project, you have to submit your assignment. But before you can submit it, you have to grade 1 or 2 of other cadidates. In theory, this is a good move by Coursera.

  
BUT, I received some submissions from other candidates who just uploaded the same meaningless screenshot. And why? Because it allows them to see other candidates' assignments. Chances are very high that the majority will take this certificate seriously and put time and effort into the project/task. But the candidates with meaningless screenshots now have the opportunity to see the solved tasks, copy/paste them, reassign them and pass them, module by module. So I don't think you should expect too much from these Coursera certificates.

I learned this on Coursera funny enough from Learning how to Learn by Barbara Oakley.

It's called interleaving, and consists in mixing and switching between multiple subjects, topics, and problems, in order to give the mind time to consolidate the knowledge and also create patterns in between.

For example, if I'm studying math and physics, instead of focusing on math or physics, it would be better to do 1 hour of physics and then 1 hour of math (order and time doesn't matter as long as you switch), and then by the end of the day you will have learned more and also will be able to recall much more and create more connections between the physics and math.

1292,t3_spenk0,coursera,"Hello! I just finished this specialization.


For this specialization you don't need any specific software, until the last course where you'll need ro download and install R and Rstudio (but don't worry, you'll get all the instructions once you get there). 


The whole specialization is very straightforward, you'll get all the info you need from the videos and specified recommended readings. There are no peer graded projects, only graded quizes, one for each week and a course challenge quiz. Almost every course is 4-5 weeks long and only one is 6 weeks long, but it's easy to finish then in way less time.


For the first courses you'll be using mainly google sheets and google cloud (for SQL, in one course they'll give you instructions to access for free), you can also use MS excel if you want instead of google sheets.


For note taking you can use simply pen and paper or take digital notes if you like. The quizzes are not that hard. 


Consistency is key, set up a specific time of the day for learning and stick to your schedule. If you ever get stuck check out the discussion forums or look up info online, but you probably won't need more material than what is presented in each course.


Good luck and have fun learning!",1237,218,hello i just finished this specialization for this specialization you don t need any specific software until the last course where you ll need ro download and install r and rstudio but don t worry you ll get all the instruction once you get there the whole specialization is very straightforward you ll get all the info you need from the video and specified recommended reading there are no peer graded project only graded quiz one for each week and a course challenge quiz almost every course is 4 5 week long and only one is 6 week long but it s easy to finish then in way le time for the first course you ll be using mainly google sheet and google cloud for sql in one course they ll give you instruction to access for free you can also use m excel if you want instead of google sheet for note taking you can use simply pen and paper or take digital note if you like the quiz are not that hard consistency is key set up a specific time of the day for learning and stick to your schedule if you ever get stuck check out the discussion forum or look up info online but you probably won t need more material than what is presented in each course good luck and have fun learning,hello i just finish thi special for thi special you don t need ani specif softwar until the last cours where you ll need ro download and instal r and rstudio but don t worri you ll get all the instruct onc you get there the whole special is veri straightforward you ll get all the info you need from the video and specifi recommend read there are no peer grade project onli grade quiz one for each week and a cours challeng quiz almost everi cours is 4 5 week long and onli one is 6 week long but it s easi to finish then in way less time for the first cours you ll be use mainli googl sheet and googl cloud for sql in one cours they ll give you instruct to access for free you can also use ms excel if you want instead of googl sheet for note take you can use simpli pen and paper or take digit note if you like the quizz are not that hard consist is key set up a specif time of the day for learn and stick to your schedul if you ever get stuck check out the discuss forum or look up info onlin but you probabl won t need more materi than what is present in each cours good luck and have fun learn

1443,t3_qmhodr,coursera,"I am currently doing the [University of Michigan Applied Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python).

Reviews so far:

1. **Introduction** \- Really damn good. Cleared up my concepts really well. They recommended some experience in python beforehand, but I still did well regardless and picked it along the way from the course hints, and some manual searching. (I have a background in CS, and I am a nerd, so consider that.)
2. **Matplotlib** \- I didn't enjoy the tutorials as much as the first course. Went from 0 to 100 really quick. The questions seemed a bit tough due to the same reason, but the quality of the questions and the insights provided in the lectures was really good. Just do some external research and documentation reading, use StackOverflow.
3. **Applied Machine Learning** \- Currently in Week 2. Loving it so far! It's a little longer than the previous ones, and the pacing is really great, cleared up the basics really well as well.

As for the rest, I'll update this comment and make a post when I am done.

P.S. Personally, I don't recommend the others like [IBM Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science), or the [Johns Hopkins Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) one because: 

1) I did a little bit of the IBM course on EDx, and the quality was lacking. Not to mention IBM Watson Cloud (where you'll spend a lotta time with the IBM Course was kinda inconvenient.)

1448,t3_qlzfq7,coursera,"For the most part, those courses are legit. You learn as much (or as little) as in a University course. But the class is not 25 people but 10,000, so they can be much cheaper. By the price, I'm guessing that you're referring to Google UX Design Professional Certificate, by Google right? Those are a little more practice-oriented than the usual academic courses... Google makes great courses, you'll end up with actual knowledge. But it's, and I can't stress it enough, **entry** level. The assumption is that you don't know anything, so by the end, you'll know the basics.  


How does it work in general? Most of the courses at Coursera contain at minimum:

\- videos with lectures, usually in 5-15 minute prices  
\- thing to read  
\- some tests  


In paid versions, you'll also get access to the very unintuitive forum, and some exercise that is more than just A/B test. It'll probably be peer audited. You'll check someone's work if it meets project criteria, someone else will check yours.  


Long story short. Start with free. If you're looking for certification, you may need to pay for something. If you're looking for KNOWLEDGE, you can get it all for free.  


Let's look into the Foundations of User Experience (UX) Design. If you try to sign up from the main page, you only get the ""7 day try"" option. But in the bottom of the same window, there is also ""**audit**"" the course. It's a free access to videos and lessons. But without the exercise and certification.

Now for the review:

Overall, the platform is great for someone looking to learn a new skill in a broad selection of topics (which you can all view).  


**Pacing: (4/5)**  
Courses / Specializations may or may not have actual deadlines.  
The two types:

  
1. Flexible times  
Some Specializations / Courses allow you to finish it at any time you want. It will say a deadline regardless but this is only so you can finish them at the recommend time. If you ever feel like you forgot about the classes and wish to continue them, you can always press the ""Reset Deadlines"" to get back on track.  
2. Hard deadlines  
Some courses will basically be like an actual college degree with the only difference of you doing it entirely at the comfort of your home. These have Hard deadlines that you cannot reset because these ones are designed ideally for everyone to finish at the same time and graduate together.  


So how do I know which one of the two this Course / Specialization is?  
Go to the main page of whatever class you want to take and it should mention it along with the other general information.

Reason for 4/5 rating:  
The weekly load will ultimately depend on whether you can finish it or not. The system is not perfect but you basically have to adapt to whatever material you must cover in an entire week.  


**Difficulties: (4/5)**  
Courses / Specializations are rated depending on how much knowledge you should have about the topic before you enroll in it.  
1. Beginner  
Little to no knowledge at all about the topic  
2. Intermediate  
Being familiar with the topic helps but you can still take it  
3. Advanced  
You should have a solid background in the topic before trying this out  


Reason for 4/5 rating:  
I've finished a beginner course before that had a bit of python programming in the end. Man, was the transition rough for that specific course. The course was initially designed to help the student think through computational thinking and algorithms then finally introduce the student to the Python programming language. This is so they can apply their knowledge and use it on a computer interface. It was quite difficult for me because the pacing suddenly changed. I finished the course anyway and do not regret it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Financial Overview: (4/5)**  
You have *2 options* to choose from when enrolling in the courses:  
1. Purchase the course:   
This will save you money if you only wanted to take 1-2 courses in a span of an entire month anyway. Becomes too expensive if you want to take more than 3, just subscribe.  


2.  Subscribing:  
Pay for a fixed monthly fee to view the entire catalogue of courses available to Coursera Plus. This is the best option if you want to learn multiple classes at once and you have set your mindset to completing these.  
**THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE ONES THAT FUNCTION AS A COLLEGE DEGREE / MASTERAL DEGREE ETC.**  


Reason for 4/5 rating:  
I don't really mind the 59 USD per month. However, there are some weird things that happen once in a while in this platform. Recently, they changed the system and the unenroll button was gone. But wait! it's alright don't worry... it only seems to affect Coursera Plus subscribers and the courses I took didn't have hard deadlines to begin with.

1. Completely blank assignments. The person submitting the assignment would resubmit it until they were lucky enough to get two graders in a row who passed them for some reason (cheater's camaraderie?).
2. Answers to a completely different assignment, presumably copied from somewhere on the web.  Again, they would just resubmit until they got two passes in a row.
3. First they would submit either 1) or 2) only to subsequently get failed by peer graders. However by this point they have the answer key for peer grading. So then they would just copy and paste from the answer key and resubmit. I saw an actual screenshot of the answer key once.

You can report submissions for plagiarism, which is very straightforward for 3). For 2) it is trickier, as its hard to prove they are plagiarizing if you don't know the source. I tried reporting 1) but it isn't technically against Coursera's rules. So in that case I can only give them a 0 and hope other peer graders do the same.

These courses are usually taught in first and second year of Mechanical Engineering.

If you are into robotics you can take the IOT specialization, the Robotics specialization by Upenn, or the modern robotics specialization by the Northwestern University. But these courses require you to be adept in programming.

You can also take CAD courses.
